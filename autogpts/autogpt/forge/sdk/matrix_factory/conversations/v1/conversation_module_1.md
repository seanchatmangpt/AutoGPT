Living Documentation and Quick Start Guide

It's tempting to dismiss documentation, with the mindset that the code, in the end, is all that is needed. That is a dangerous assumption.

Clean, well-documented code can be a developer's best friend - it guides and hints the way to implementing features efficiently. The long-term cost of writing good documentation is miniscule, while the short-term investment to get initial implementation done, is a boon.

That said, documentation, done well, is never really done. It is always important to document changes and share that with the community so that they can understand the impact of said change in terms of current and future implementation steps.

Having a Quick Start Guide (or "Living Documentation") is also very helpful in allowing a new developer to quickly get their bearings, and get started.

If Developers Have IDE

Knowledge of which IDE to use

Knowing how to use that IDE to implement new features <-- Good Developers -->

--> Minimal time and energy spent on development && documentation

1. We make sure that the README is always up-to-date and accurate by using a tool like readme.io that allows us to automatically generate and update our README files.

2. We make sure that the README is easy to navigate by using clear and concise headers and sections.

3. We make sure that the README is user-centric by including relevant and useful information in the featured modules section.

4. We make sure that the README is robust by including a link to our support site in the event that something goes wrong.
