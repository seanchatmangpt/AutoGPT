David Robinson (author of Object-Oriented Software Development) 'I'm not sure I feel the way about 'OnlineContractAdminCapability' as my opinion is that contract-admin is various UI-related pieces and NLP-related pieces – I think it should just be broken out into atomic functions, within the context of the contract-admin application or application of some form'

Luciano Ramalho 'This is an independent discussion about API Design. If you are judging development, then no response is needed!'

David Robinson 'I've never contracted before – is the objective of a design to modify a time-based agreement (JOB) dispute management system? Is the term 'tolerance' being used the 'contract is the consensus between two negotiating parties' sense? Is this a commercial product or a freelance service?

This person did not wish to give any further responses.

Luciano Ramalho "Obviously this is going to be changed and become more than the outlined stuff.

We start asking questions and write the responses to where do they want to go or with the questions they have previously overlooked.

So far we have a backlog of the following project roadmap.

In Domain-Driven Design, a bounded context is a contextual boundary which defines the scope for a certain model. This means that each feature listed here would likely be its own bounded context, as they each represent a separate area of concern. For example, the "Dashboard with Contract Metrics" feature would likely have its own bounded context, as it deals with specific data and metrics related to contracts. The other features would likely each have their own bounded contexts as well.

1. Structure the project into small, discrete modules, each with its own well-defined purpose. Keep the code within each module simple and well-structured. 

2. Refactor early and often. Review the code regularly for opportunities to streamline, simplify, and improve performance. 

3. Write unit and integration tests for React components, models, and persistent objects. Run them regularly to ensure that new features are functioning as intended.

4. Factor out common operation and behavior into reusable components. This will help minimize redundant code and simplify the development process. 

5. Use source control to track changes to the project over time. This will make it easier to revert to a previous version if something goes wrong. 

6. Utilize design patterns to ensure a consistent UX and structure throughout the project. This will also make it easier to maintain your code in the long run. 

7. Utilize language features, like class composition, to keep the code maintainable and easily extendable. 

8. Implement continuous integration to ensure that the project remains stable and efficient as it grows. Run automated tests, builds, and deployments to keep the codebase

To ensure that the Readme is both robust and user-centric, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with a clear and concise title for the README that accurately reflects the purpose and features of the "OnlineContractAdminCapability".

2. Begin by providing a brief overview or introduction to the "OnlineContractAdminCapability". This should include a high-level description of the product, its main features, and its intended users.

3. Clearly define and describe the features of the "OnlineContractAdminCapability". Use bullet points or numbered lists to make the information easy to read and understand.

4. Provide examples or screenshots of the product in action. This will give users a better idea of what to expect and how the features work.

5. Include any necessary installation instructions or system requirements for using the "OnlineContractAdminCapability". This will help users understand if the product is compatible with their system and how to get started.

6. Next, we can focus on the robustness of the product. This includes ensuring that all features are thoroughly tested and function as expected. We should also highlight any known limitations or issues and provide possible solutions or workarounds.

7. To ensure that the "OnlineContractAdminCapability" is user-centric, we should consider
