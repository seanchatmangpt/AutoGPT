The Domain-Driven Design would involve:

1. WebModules: This would define the core objects and high-level structure of the WebModule in terms of interacting objects and operations. To make the most of Python's strengths, the class should have an emphasis on easy subclassing and flexible customization. 

2. Dashboard: This would define the dashboard with web performance metrics and SEO health features, such as defining different views, setting up charts, and metrics. 

3. WebPropertyManager: This would define the web property manager with a live preview and other associated features, such as editing, adding, and deleting different web properties. 

4. ContentInfusionTools: This would define the content infusion tools with competitive radar insights, such as tracking changes and tracking keywords for better ranking in search results. 

5. IntegrationManagement: This would define the module integration management for integrating CRM, email, and financial data for improved analyzing of customer behavior. 

6. Analytics: This would define the website analytics and user behavior tracking, including tracking visitor movements, observing user behavior, and creating reports.

1. Understand the principles of React: Before diving into implementing any of the features mentioned, it's important to have a solid understanding of the principles of React. This includes understanding how components work, how data flows in a React application, and how to manage state.

2. Start with a solid architecture: The first step in implementing these features is to have a solid architecture in place. This includes setting up a folder structure and deciding on a state management library (such as Redux or MobX). This will help you maintain a clean and organized codebase as your project grows.

3. Use reusable components: One of the main benefits of React is the ability to create reusable components. These components can be shared across different parts of the application, reducing code duplication and making maintenance easier. A good approach is to start by creating small, reusable components and then combine them to create more complex ones.

4. Implement code splitting: To improve performance, it's important to implement code splitting in your React application. This involves breaking your code into smaller chunks and loading them only when needed. This can significantly reduce initial load time and improve user experience.

5. Utilize server-side rendering: Another way to improve performance is by using server-side rendering (SSR).
