A Domain model for this system could be composed by the following entities: 

– System: to keep track of the system-wide settings and preferences
– User: to manage users and roles
– AuditTrail: to store all system-wide audit trails
– Security: to configure federated security
– Integration: to handle external system integrations
– Theme: to manage and customize UI/themes
– Dashboard: to display a summary of system health and usage metrics

The following value objects could also be created:

– Time: to track the time of when certain actions occur
– Measurement: to store system usage metrics
– Configuration: to store system configurations

These entities can be further composed using relationships such as:

– System is composed of several Users
– User is composed of several AuditTrails
– User is associated with one Theme
– AuditTrail can refer to several Users
– AuditTrail can refer to several Configurations
– Integration is associated with one Security
– Security is associated with one Measurement
– Theme is associated with one Measurement
– Dashboard can refer to several Users, Themes and Configurations

1. Start with a Good Foundation: Before diving into writing code for the AdministrationModule, make sure to lay a solid foundation for your project. This can include setting up a code organization structure, choosing a code style guide, and implementing a version control system. Having these in place will make it easier to maintain the codebase and collaborate with other developers.

2. Design with Reusability in Mind: When designing the AdministrationModule, think about how its components and logic can be reused in other parts of your system. This will help avoid duplication of code and ensure consistency across the application.

3. Use a Routing Library: To handle the different pages and features of the AdministrationModule, it's recommended to use a routing library. This will make it easier to manage navigation and keep the UI in sync with the URL. Popular choices include React Router and Reach Router.

4. Utilize Props and State Effectively: In React, components can communicate with each other through props and state. Make sure to utilize these features effectively to pass data and manage the state of your components. This will help keep your code clean and organized.

5. Implement a Theme Switching Feature: Allow users to customize the look and feel of the AdministrationModule by implementing a
