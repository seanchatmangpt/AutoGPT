Dashboard with Contract Metrics (e.g., approval rates, pending reviews)': 

// To create the dashboard, build out components for a summarization of the contract metrics such as approval rates, pending reviews, etc. These components would be built into a parent component with the ability to update the data source. This will make the dashboard dynamic and able to present up-to-date metrics. Once the components are built, use a library such as Recharts for visualization.

'Interactive Contract Query Tool with Natural Language Processing':

// This could be achieved through the use of an API such as Microsoft LUIS. This API could be used to interpret natural language queries into structured requests to be passed to functions in the application. These functions can then process the query and retrieve the requested data.

'Tolerance and Compliance Rule Management':

// Create functions that validate the data sources to ensure that they adhere to defined tolerance and compliance rule specifications. Functions should also be created to ensure that compliance rules can be updated and maintained.

'Stack Management with Label Customization':

// Build out components to display and manipulate the stack, as well as allow customization of labels for easier organizing.
