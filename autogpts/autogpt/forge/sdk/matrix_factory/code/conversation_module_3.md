'Upload Contract with File Format Validation'

The bounded context of the OnlineContractSigningFacility can be divided up into the following contexts:

1. Dashboard: Contains the actions pending such as signatures required, review tasks, etc.

2. File Format Validation: This context handles verifying that the contract being uploaded is in a suitable file format.

3. Interactive Contract Markup and Annotation: This context enables users to markup and annotate a contract interactively.

4. Signatory and Carbon Copy Management: This context handles managing the signatories and any carbon copies of the contract.

5. Digital Signature Pad: This context handles user identity verification in order to equip the digital signature pad with appropriate security.

6. Contract Review and Approval Workflow Visualization: This context handles enabling a visual workflow that enables a user to review and approve a contract.

7. Contract Metadata and Details Pane: This context handles displaying the associated metadata and details of a contract.

8. Contract Version History and Change Tracking: This context handles tracking the version history and any changes made to a contract.

Given the complexity and number of features in this project, ensuring a maintainable and efficient codebase is crucial. We recommend following these guidelines to achieve this goal.'

1. Design and Code For Reusability 
- Reusability is key in developing a maintainable and efficient codebase. Identify common patterns and functionality across different features and create reusable components. For example, a "signatory" component can be reused in both the "Signatory and Carbon Copy Management" and "Digital Signature Pad" features.
- Use composition instead of inheritance when designing components. This allows for greater flexibility and easier maintenance in the future.
- Utilize React hooks and higher-order components to encapsulate and reuse functionality across multiple components.

2. Follow a Modular Approach 
- Divide the project into smaller, manageable modules, each responsible for a specific feature or functionality.
- Use a component-based architecture, where each module contains its own set of components and logic. This allows for better organization and separation of concerns.
- Use a state management library like Redux to manage shared state between modules.

3. Write Maintainable Code 
- Write clean and concise code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Use comments to describe complex logic or

In order to ensure that the README "OnlineContractSigningFacility" is robust and user-centric, we should follow these pragmatic steps:

1. Identify and prioritize key features: First, we need to identify and prioritize the key features of the OnlineContractSigningFacility. Based on the features mentioned in the README, we can break them down into three categories - Dashboard Features, Contract Management Features, and User Verification Features. This will help us to focus on the most important aspects of the facility and ensure that we deliver the most value to our users.

2. Conduct usability testing: In order to make sure that the OnlineContractSigningFacility is user-centric, we need to conduct thorough usability testing. This will help us to understand how users interact with the facility and identify any potential pain points or usability issues. We can also gather valuable feedback from users and make necessary improvements based on their input.

3. Use a version control system: To ensure that the facility is robust, we should use a version control system to track all changes and updates made to the codebase. This will allow us to easily revert any changes that cause issues and maintain a stable and functioning facility.

4. Implement proper error handling: Error handling is crucial for the robustness of
