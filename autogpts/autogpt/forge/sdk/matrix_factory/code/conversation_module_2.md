The key to implementing these features in a maintainable and efficient manner is to follow some key principles from The Pragmatic Programmer:

1. Modular Development: Break down the administration module into smaller, modular components that can be easily managed and maintained.
2. Keep it Simple: Strive for simplicity in design and implementation to make it easier to understand and modify in the future.
3. Avoid Duplication: Make use of reusable components and avoid code duplication to reduce maintenance efforts.
4. Continuous Testing: Write automated tests for the administration module to ensure that any changes or updates do not

- Add an explicit description of the README page goals and success criteria to ensure the inclusion of the most important points for README authors to make

- Having a unifying and identifiable symbol that links all README pages together to ensure consistency with all audiences.

- Recruit contributors with README author experience across all READMEs to have features represented in this README cover all system requirements in as many detail as possible.

From a pragmatic perspective, here is how we ensure that the README "AdministrationModule" with features ['Dashboard with Summary of System Health and Usage Metrics', 'Themes and UI Customization Options', 'User and Role Management', 'Federated Security Configuration', 'System-wide Audit Trail Logs', 'External System Integrations Management', 'System Preferences and Global Settings'] is both robust and user-centric
