Gather Requirements'

1. Understand the problem: In order to implement the React "WebModule", it is important to first fully understand the problem or need. This includes understanding the specific features and functionalities desired, as well as any potential constraints or limitations.

2. Define clear goals: Once the problem has been fully understood, it is important to define clear and achievable goals for the project. This will help guide the development process and ensure that the end product meets the desired requirements.

3. Prioritize features: Not all features are created equal. It is important to prioritize the desired features in order to focus on the most important and impactful ones first.

'Design and Develop'

1. Use a modular approach: The React "WebModule" should be designed and developed using a modular approach. This will allow for easier maintenance and scalability in the future.

2. Keep code clean and maintainable: Following good coding principles such as separation of concerns and single responsibility will help keep the code clean and maintainable. This will make it easier to add new features or make changes in the future.

3. Use reusable components: To save time and improve efficiency, it is important to create reusable components within the React "WebModule". This will also help maintain consistency
