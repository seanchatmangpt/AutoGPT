The OnlineContractSigningFacility bounded context is focused on enabling users to create, upload, validate, annotate, track, and securely approve contracts. It is composed of several features, such as a dashboard with pending actions, a tool for uploading contracts with file format validation, an interactive markup and annotation tool, signatory and carbon copy management, a Digital Signature Pad with user identity verification, a contract review and approval workflow visualization, a contract metadata and details pane, and a contract version history and change tracking. All of these features work together to provide a secure and reliable system for creating and approving contracts.'

Given that React is a component-based library, the first step in implementing the AdministrationModule is to break it down into smaller, reusable components. This will not only make the code more manageable, but will also reduce the chances of code duplication. Each of the features listed can be implemented as a separate component, with their respective functionalities and state managed within the component itself.

For the Dashboard with Summary of System Health and Usage Metrics, start by creating a component that will fetch and display the relevant data. This component can then be used in the main Dashboard component, which will provide the layout and organization of the data.

Themes and UI Customization Options can be implemented by creating a higher-order component (HOC) that will wrap the main component, passing in the desired theme or customization options. This will allow for easy switching between themes/customizations without having to change the code in each individual component.

For User and Role Management, a separate component can be created for each feature, such as creating a user, assigning roles, and managing permissions. These components can then be imported into a main UserManagement component, which will handle the overall functionality and data management.

Federated Security Configuration can also be implemented as a HOC that will wrap the necessary components and

Ensure proper component structure and separation of concerns'

- Start by breaking down the overall functionality into smaller components that have specific tasks and responsibilities. This will help keep your code organized and maintainable in the long run. For example, you can have separate components for the dashboard, event creation wizard, historical performance analysis, etc.

- Each component should be responsible for a single functionality and should not have any additional tasks or responsibilities. This will make it easier to test and debug in the future.

- Use React's lifecycle methods, such as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, to handle any data fetching and manipulation. This will help keep your components decoupled and efficient.

- Utilize React's PropTypes to validate the data being passed down to child components. This will help catch any errors and ensure proper data flow in your application.

'Implement reusable and modular code'

- Instead of duplicating code, look for opportunities to create reusable components. This will save you time and effort in the long run, as you can simply reuse these components whenever needed.

- Use higher-order components (HOCs) to share functionality between components. This will help reduce code duplication and keep your code maintainable.

- Consider using design patterns like the Container/Presenter or Presentational/Container
