In order to ensure that the README describing the "OnlineContractSigningFacility" project is both robust and user-centric, we will follow a set of pragmatic steps:

1. Determine user needs: The first step is to understand the needs of the potential users of this project. This can be achieved by conducting user interviews or surveys to gather feedback on what features and functionalities they would like to see in an online contract signing facility. This will form the basis of the features that will be included in the README.

2. Prioritize features: Once the user needs have been identified, the next step is to prioritize the features based on their importance to the user. This will help in deciding which features should be given more prominence in the README and also in the development process.

3. Communicate clearly: The README should provide clear and concise information about the project, its features, and how it can benefit the users. It should also include any technical specifications or requirements that the user needs to know.

4. Include user scenarios: In addition to a list of features, it would be beneficial to include user scenarios in the README. This will help the users understand the project in a real-world context and see how the features will be used in their day-to-day

Given the tenets of The Pragmatic Programmer, here is my advice for implementing the React "OnlineContractSigningFacility" with features 
['Dashboard with Pending Actions (e.g., signatures required, review tasks)', 'Upload Contract with File Format Validation', 'Interactive Contract Markup and Annotation Tool', 'Signatory and Carbon Copy Management', 'Digital Signature Pad with User Identity Verification', 'Contract Review and Approval Workflow Visualization', 'Contract Metadata and Details Pane', 'Contract Version History and Change Tracking'] in a maintainable and efficient manner:

1. Start by breaking down the overall "OnlineContractSigningFacility" into smaller components based on each of the features mentioned. This will make it easier to manage and maintain later on.

2. Use functional components wherever possible, as they are easier to read and maintain.

3. Use React hooks to handle state management, instead of relying on class components and lifecycle methods.

4. Utilize Redux or a similar state management library to keep your components decoupled and make it easier to test and debug.

5. Make use of reusable components and avoid duplicating code. This will save time and effort in the long run.

6. Follow a consistent folder and file structure to organize your code, making it

Python's dynamic typing, higher order functions, and decorators make it powerful and expressive for DDD design.

In this case, we could use the decorator pattern to add functionality to our home class, based on the different features we want to include. We could create a base home class with some basic functionality, and then create decorators for each feature that would add specific behavior to it.

For example, we could have a decorator for the "Welcome Message" feature that would add a method to display a personalized message to the user when they access the home page. Another decorator for the "Dashboard Overview of All Modules" feature would add a method to display an overview of all the modules available in the system.

The dynamic navigation to featured modules could be implemented using higher order functions. We could create a function that takes in a module name and returns a method that would dynamically navigate the user to that specific module. This function could then be used as a decorator for the home class, adding this functionality to it.

For system notifications and alerts, we could use Python's built-in logging module to handle and display them. We could create a class that handles the different types of notifications and a decorator that adds this functionality to the home class.

Integration Management for CRM, Email, and Financial Data'
- Objects related to CRM, Email and Financial data should be designed for smooth integration through their use of standardized APIs
- Design a process that passes the data through data cleaning and validation steps before it can be used
- Implement a messaging system that handles any errors or updates from the integrated systems

'Dashboard with Web Performance Metrics and SEO Health'
- Develop a system that periodically polls and stores performance and SEO data from the website
- Use this data to generate custom reports and charts for the dashboard, using tools like D3 or Chart.js
- Implement custom alerts for critical performance issues or SEO violations

'Web Property Manager with Live Preview'
- Create a comprehensive data model for all website properties and their associated data (content, metadata, styling)
- Develop a UI layer that allows for live previews and editing of website properties, leveraging tools like Draft.js or React-Quill
- Design a robust security system to prevent unauthorized changes to website properties

'Content Infusion Tools with Competitive Radar Insights'
- Develop a content management system that allows for easy creation, editing, and scheduling of website content
- Integrate tools for competitive analysis, such as SEMrush or Ahrefs, to
