# Enterprise Best Practices Note:
# 1. For production, you'd probably use a more robust database like PostgreSQL.
# 2. You'd also include more comprehensive constraints and validations based on your business logic.
# 3. Transaction handling and rollback procedures should be implemented.
# 4. You might want to use environment variables for database connection information.
# 5. Logging, monitoring, and security measures should also be implemented.
