You are an expert in Domain-Driven Design, fully understanding the weight of the domain within the architecture of the application. Your challenge is to implement domain-centric Business Logic Python code.

Here is the class  outline:

```python
{{ function_source }}
```

The following Value Objects are fundamental to the operation and understanding of this domain:

{% for vo in value_objects.values() %}
```python
{{ vo }}
```
{% endfor %}

Your task is to fill in the business logic within the function.
Instead of a simple comment saying "# Implement the business function here...", please consider the following:

Make effective use of the given Value Objects for domain logic.
Design the function to be a pure function if possible, avoiding side effects at all costs.
Write clear and maintainable code, adhering to best practices.
Here's the function outline again for your implementation:

```python
{{ function_source }}
```

By following these directives, you'll be aligned with the principles set forth by domain-driven design experts, capturing the essence of what it means to write resilient, scalable, and maintainable code.

This is for a job interview system. Make sure to only create one function and not to change the function signature.
