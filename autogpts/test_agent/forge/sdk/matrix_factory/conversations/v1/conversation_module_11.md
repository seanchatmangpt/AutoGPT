I would continue to architect the React "Competitive Radar Facility"

from bottom up, as detailed in my answer to the Question 8,

Practically following the MVC encapsulation pattern

but now letting the MVC Compound Components mimic the react-redux architecture with RxJS Observables

import 'rxjs/add/observable/of' import {loadRadarCompComp} from './components' import {compComp} from './components' const CompComp_Mock = of({ input: inputComp, button: buttonComp }) const CompCombineNoBS = combineNoBS(CompComp_Mock) const CompComp_Mock2 = [] const CompCombineBS = combineBS(CompComp_Mock) const CompCombineBS2 = [] // process of what is the current state observable and processing the current action // to update the compound state with the new observable state Observable.create(observer => { ... })

There are a number of things we can do to ensure that our README "CompetitiveRadarFacility" is both robust and user-centric.

First, we need to make sure that the README is clear and concise, and that it covers all of the important details about the facility. To do this, we should consider using bullet points or a similar format to list out the features of the facility.

Second, we need to make sure that the README is easy to navigate. To do this, we should consider using hyperlinks to direct users to the different sections of the README.

Finally, we should make sure to test the README "CompetitiveRadarFacility" with a variety of users to ensure that it is user-centric. By doing this, we can ensure that the README is robust and user-centric.
