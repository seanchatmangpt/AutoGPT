User Manuals and Interactive Guides' -> 'Documentation'

'technical Documentation Library' -> 'Documentation'

'Frequently Asked Questions... FAQ)' -> 'Documentation'

'System Version and Update Notes' -> 'Documentation'

```

So, the MONGODB, POSTGRESQL, PYTHON, and GIT repositories would be in my opinion (from my interpretation) in an area of the codebase that is called the "Documentation" bounded context"

"Adam Stewart:

The use of git as the sole artifact for this section is a lack of holistic design, which brings in the domain where the entire business is managed with git.

On this point I completely agree with your design point.

Adam Stewart:

Resources like user groups and technical blogs

This sounds like a component in the "Marketing" bounded context. Remember the importance of naming bounded contexts.

Resources like user groups and technical blogs would be in the Marketing bounded context."

"Vaughn Vernon:

Agreed.

1. User Manuals and Interactive Guides: Create detailed instructional manuals that walk users through different features of the product/system. If possible, incorporate interactive elements, like videos and images, that help to accurately explain key concepts.

2. Technical Documentation Library: Store code references, software definitions, deployment guides, and setup walkthroughs in an easily searchable library for users to quickly and clearly access when needed.

3. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Compile a comprehensive list of common questions and issues experienced by users for quick resolution. Include screenshots and easy-to-follow instructions in the answers.

4. System Version and Update Notes: Maintain an accurate record of system versions and release notes. When a new version or update is released, inform users and offer tutorials and help resources to ensure successful transitions."
