Using Python's strengths, we can create a hierarchical structure for our domain model that reflects the different types of tools and features offered by our financial software connection facility. At the top level, we have the 'Financial Software Connection Facility' which represents our domain model. Underneath this, we have separate value objects for our 'Dashboard', 'Financial Data Summary', and 'Health Metrics'. These value objects are used to store and manipulate data within the overall domain model.

Next, we have an 'ERP Data Integration Tool' which is an aggregate of various entities. These entities include the 'ERP Data Management Tool', 'Financial Transaction Explorer', 'GL Tool

This is a sample React component that demonstrates how to implement
a Financial Software Connection Facility with features ['Dashboard with Financial Data Summary and Health Metrics', 'ERP Data Integration and Management Tools', 'Financial Transaction Explorer', 'GL, AP, and AR Automated Entry Tools', 'Real-time Financial Reporting and Data Visualization'].

To ensure that the README "FinancialSoftwareConnectionFacility" is robust and user-centric, we will take a series of steps. First, we will evaluate how the listed features fit the needs of our users and their financial software environment. This will help us ensure that the features offered are necessary and appropriately scaled to match our user's needs. Then, we will conduct usability testing throughout the development process to ensure the software fits our user's needs and also verify that the features are intuitive and easy to use. 

Once development is complete, we will conduct a thorough review and testing of the features to ensure that they are all functional and robust, and to identify any areas of improvement. Further, we will use analytics and other data to assess overall user experience, confirm that usage remains consistent over time, and verify that system performance meets our standards. Only then the software can be released for public use.

This process will help ensure that the software is both robust and user-centric, meeting the necessary standards for both technical performance and user experience.
