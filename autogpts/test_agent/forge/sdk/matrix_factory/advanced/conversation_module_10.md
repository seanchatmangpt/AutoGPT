1. Clearly Define the Purpose and Goals of the EventPlanningFacility: Before starting the development process, it is important to clearly define the purpose and goals of the EventPlanningFacility. This will ensure that all features and functionality are aligned and relevant to the overall purpose of the tool. It will also help prioritize features and make sure they align with the goals of the users.

2. Involve Stakeholders in the Planning Process: It is important to involve stakeholders in the planning process to get their input and feedback on the features and functionality. They can provide valuable insights and help identify any potential gaps in the tool.

3. Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Instead of trying to include all the features in one go, it is better to start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This will allow for faster development and testing, and give users the opportunity to provide feedback and suggest additional features.

4. Conduct User Research and Testing: User research and testing are crucial to ensure that the features of the EventPlanningFacility are user-centric and meet the needs of the target audience. This will help identify any usability issues and gather feedback for improvements.

5. Prioritize Features Based on User Needs: Once user research and
