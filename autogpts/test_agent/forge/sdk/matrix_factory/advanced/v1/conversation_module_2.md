Firstly, the concept of DDD (Domain-Driven Design) is about creating a model of the domain which matches its business requirements. To frame this in a Python context, we can consider each feature as a sub-domain, potentially having its own set of services, entities, and value objects. Here is an example representation of this.

```python
class AdministrationModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dashboard = DashboardModule()
        self.themes_ui_customization = ThemesUICustomizationModule()
        self.user_role_management = UserRoleManagementModule()
        self.federated_security = FederatedSecurityModule()
        self.audit_trail_logs = AuditTrailLogsModule()
        self.external_system_integration = ExternalSystemIntegrationModule()
        self.system_preferences_global_settings = SystemPreferencesGlobalSettingsModule()

class DashboardModule:
    def display_system_health_and_usage_metrics(self):
        pass

class ThemesUICustomizationModule:
    def set_theme(self, theme):
        pass

    def set_ui_customization_options(self, options):
        pass

class UserRoleManagementModule:
    def manage_user(self, user):
        pass

    def manage_role(self, role):
        pass

class FederatedSecurityModule:
    def configure_federated_security(self, configuration):
        pass

class AuditTrailLogsModule:
    def log_audit_trail(self, log):
        pass

class ExternalSystemIntegrationModule:
    def manage_external_system_integration(self, integration):
        pass

class SystemPreferencesGlobalSettingsModule:
    def set_system_preference(self, preference):
        pass

    def set_global_setting(self, setting):
        pass

```
Each module corresponds to a feature provided by the 'AdministrationModule'. These modules encapsulate the behaviour associated with the respective domain, providing a clear separation of concerns.

Remember that DDD is about the strategic design of the software reflecting the domain model rather than specific coding strategies. Therefore, the above python design is an abstract representation and can be altered as per the specific business logic and details of each feature.

This code does not include the supporting elements like Entities, Aggregates, Value Objects, Repositories, etc. These should also be defined based on the complexity and requirements of each sub-domain for a complete DDD implementation. 

In a real-world Python Application, these would be classes with their own attributes and methods implementing business logic and rules of the domain.

class AdministrationModule extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Dashboard />
        <ThemesAndUICustomization />
        <UserAndRoleManagement />
        <FederatedSecurityConfiguration />
        <AuditTrailLogs />
        <ExternalSystemIntegrations />
        <GlobalSettings />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Dashboard component
class Dashboard extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Fetch and display system health and usage metrics
    // Implement any required logic here
    return <div>Dashboard content here</div>;
  }
}

// Themes and UI customization component
class ThemesAndUICustomization extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Provide themes and customization options
    // Implement any required logic here
    return <div>Themes and UI Customization content here</div>;
  }
}

// User and role management component
class UserAndRoleManagement extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Fetch and manage users and their roles
    // Implement any required logic here
    return <div>User and Role Management content here</div>;
  }
}

// Federated security configuration component
class FederatedSecurityConfiguration extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Manage federated security configurations
    // Implement any required logic here
    return <div>Federated Security Configuration content here</div>;
  }
}

// System-wide audit trail logs component
class AuditTrailLogs extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Display and manage audit logs
    // Implement any required logic here
    return <div>Audit Trail Logs content here</div>;
  }
}

// External system integrations management component
class ExternalSystemIntegrations extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Manage external system integrations
    // Implement any required logic here
    return <div>External System Integrations Management content here</div>;
  }
}

// System preferences and global settings component
class GlobalSettings extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Manage system-wide preferences and settings
    // Implement any required logic here
    return <div>System Preferences and Global Settings content here</div>;
  }
}

export default AdministrationModule;
```

Here's how to follow the advice of The Pragmatic Programmer:

1. Structure components hierarchically, making them easy to understand, test, and maintain.
2. Consider using a state management library such as Redux to manage global state and maintain consistency across the application.
3. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
4. Use version control, and automate testing and deployment processes to reduce human error.
5. Consistently follow code style conventions and best practices to facilitate readability and maintainability.
6. Continuously refactor and improve code quality, removing duplication and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
7. Establish clear communication channels within your team to provide constructive feedback and ensure everyone is working cohesively towards common goals.

# Administration Module README

## Introduction
The Administration module is an embedded feature-rich system, geared towards ensuring a smooth end-user experience and designed with the key principles of robustness & user-centricity. It presents a conglomerate of customizable options, actionable insights, rigorous log tracking, federated security configuration, and easy user-role management.

## Features 

### Dashboard with Summary of System Health and Usage Metrics
This feature offers an overview of the system's performance and usage. System health metrics include system availability, response times, error rates, and more. Meanwhile, usage metrics focus on active users, sessions, most-used features, etc. 

### Themes and UI Customization Options
To better tailor the administration experience, this module offers various Themes and User Interface customization options. Users can change the look and feel of the administrative dashboard based on their preferences and needs.

### User and Role Management
This feature empowers administrators to create, modify, assign roles to, and delete users. Role-based access ensures that users only see features and information that pertain to their respective roles.

### Federated Security Configuration
In-built federated security system that facilitates integrating various identity providers, ensuring secure authentication across multiple systems. It aids in maintaining the standards for cross-domain single sign-on (SSO).

### System-wide Audit Trail Logs
Keeps a comprehensive log of all the activities performed in the system. This includes modification of data, system access logs, error logs, etc. This aids in issue resolution, forensic audits, and maintaining a record of system changes over time.

### External System Integrations Management
Allows administrators to configure and manage integrations with other external systems, ensuring seamless system interoperability. 

### System Preferences and Global Settings
Allows for setting up and changing organizational-specific configurations, adjusting system-wide variables and parameters, managing default settings, etc.

## Conclusion
Designed to be both robust and user-centric, the Administration Module is a comprehensive tool for system administrators, aiding in smooth, efficient, and effective management of the system.
