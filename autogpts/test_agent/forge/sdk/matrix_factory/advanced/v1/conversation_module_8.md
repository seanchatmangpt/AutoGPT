```python
from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Dict


class Event(Enum):
    UPCOMING_EVENTS = 'Dashboard with Upcoming Events and Performance Metrics'
    EVENT_CREATION = 'Event Creation Wizard with Budgeting and Resource Allocation Tools'
    HISTORICAL_ANALYSIS = 'Historical Event Performance Analysis'
    ROI_CALCULATOR = 'ROI Calculator with Customizable Metrics'
    COMPETITIVE_RADAR = 'Competitive Radar Integration for Event Strategy Insights'


class EventPlanningFacility:
    def __init__(self):
        self.features: Dict[Event, bool] = {
            event: False for event in Event
        }

    def enable_feature(self, event: Event):
        self.features[event] = True

    def disable_feature(self, event: Event):
        self.features[event] = False

    def get_enabled_features(self) -> List[Event]:
        return [event for event, enabled in self.features.items() if enabled]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    facility = EventPlanningFacility()
    facility.enable_feature(Event.UPCOMING_EVENTS)
    facility.enable_feature(Event.EVENT_CREATION)
    facility.enable_feature(Event.COMPETITIVE_RADAR)

    print(facility.get_enabled_features())
```

In this design, I have created an `Event` enum to represent the available features of the event planning facility. Each feature is associated with a string description.

The `EventPlanningFacility` class represents the event planning facility itself. It has a dictionary `features` that maps each event feature to a boolean value indicating whether the feature is enabled or disabled.

The class provides methods to enable or disable a feature, and also to get a list of enabled features.

In the `__main__` section, I create an instance of `EventPlanningFacility`, enable three features, and then print the list of enabled features.

class EventPlanningFacility:
    def __init__(self):
        self.upcoming_events = []
        self.performance_metrics = {}
        self.historical_event_performance = []
        self.event_creation_wizard = EventCreationWizard()
        self.ROI_calculator = ROICalculator()
        self.competitive_radar = CompetitiveRadar()

    def dashboard(self):
        return self.upcoming_events, self.performance_metrics

    def add_event(self, event):
        wizard = self.event_creation_wizard
        wizard.set_event_details(event)
        self.upcoming_events.append(wizard.get_event())

    def analyze_event_performance(self, event):
        analysis = self.historical_event_performance.analyze(event)
        return analysis

    def calculate_ROI(self, event):
        metrics = self.ROI_calculator.calculate(event)
        return metrics

    def get_competitor_insights(self):
        insights = self.competitive_radar.get_insights()
        return insights


class EventCreationWizard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.event = None

    def set_event_details(self, details):
        self.event = Event(details)

    def get_event(self):
        return self.event


class ROICalculator:
    def calculate(self, event):
        # complex calculation logic
        pass


class CompetitiveRadar:
    def get_insights(self):
        # complex data gathering and analysis logic
        pass


class Event:
    def __init__(self, details):
        self.details = details
```

This basic structure defines the `EventPlanningFacility` bounded context, focusing primarily on its core features, i.e., event planning, ROI calculation, performance metrics analysis, and competitive strategy insights. The classes `EventCreationWizard`, `ROICalculator`, and `CompetitiveRadar` could represent separate bounded contexts that interact with and support the `EventPlanningFacility` context. Each of these classes would be responsible for their respective domains and would interact with the main `EventPlanningFacility` class through well-defined interfaces. The `Event` class is a simple entity representing an event in the system. Please note that the logic for methods such as `ROICalcualtor.calculate` or `CompetitiveRadar.get_insights` is not implemented here, as it will depend heavily on the specific requirements of the application.

class EventPlanningFacility extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      events: [],
      metrics: [],
      performanceData: [],
      roiCalculatorData: [],
      radarIntegrationData: [],
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch data for the different features and update the state.
    // You can use methods such as the following and replace the functions with actual API calls.
    this.fetchUpcomingEvents();
    this.fetchPerformanceMetrics();
    this.fetchHistoricalEventPerformance();
    this.fetchROICalculatorData();
    this.fetchRadarIntegrationData();
  }

  fetchUpcomingEvents() {
    // Call an API to get the upcoming events data and update the state.
  }

  fetchPerformanceMetrics() {
    // Call an API to get the performance metrics data and update the state.
  }

  fetchHistoricalEventPerformance() {
    // Call an API to get the historical event performance data and update the state.
  }

  fetchROICalculatorData() {
    // Call an API to get the ROI calculator data and update the state.
  }

  fetchRadarIntegrationData() {
    // Call an API to get the radar integration data and update the state.
  }

  render() {
    const {
      events,
      metrics,
      performanceData,
      roiCalculatorData,
      radarIntegrationData,
    } = this.state;

    return (
      <div>
        <Dashboard
          events={events}
          metrics={metrics}
        />
        <EventCreationWizard />
        <HistoricalEventPerformance
          performanceData={performanceData}
        />
        <ROICalculator
          data={roiCalculatorData}
        />
        <CompetitiveRadarIntegration
          data={radarIntegrationData}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default EventPlanningFacility;

// You will need to import or create the necessary components:
// - Dashboard
// - EventCreationWizard
// - HistoricalEventPerformance
// - ROICalculator
// - CompetitiveRadarIntegration
```

Here is an outline for implementing the EventPlanningFacility component and its features, considering the tenets of The Pragmatic Programmer.

1. Use a modular approach by separating different features into their own components.
2. Organize the component states to store the necessary data for each feature.
3. Fetch the required data when the component mounts and update the state as needed.
4. Pass the data to the individual components via props.
5. Keep the business logic and presentation layers separate by implementing the logic in the main component and the presentation in the child components.
