# Feature: User Authentication

# Scenario: User can log in with valid credentials

# Given a user has a valid account

# When the user inputs their username and password
# and the credentials are valid
# Then the user is logged in to their account

# Feature: User authentication.

# Scenario: The system should require users to enter a username and password to
# access their account and verify their credentials

# Given a user has an account

# When the user inputs their username and password
# and the credentials are valid
# Then the user is granted access to their account

# Feature: Machine learning for task prioritization.
# Scenario: The system should use machine learning algorithms
# to prioritize tasks based on various factors

# Given a list of tasks

# When the system prioritizes the tasks using machine learning
# and takes into account factors such as task complexity and deadline
# Then the tasks are ordered in the most efficient way for completion

# This includes measuring execution time, identifying bottlenecks,
# and providing suggestions for optimization.

# The user should be able to view and export these reports,
# which include information such as execution time, memory usage,
# and other relevant performance metrics.

# Feature: Code analysis and optimization

# Scenario: The system should analyze code for potential performance issues
# and provide suggestions for optimization

# Given a codebase

# When the system analyzes the code for potential issues
# and suggests optimizations
# Then the user can optimize the code for better performance

# This can include code complexity, code duplication, and code coverage.

# The reports should include information such as code complexity,
# code duplication, and code coverage to help identify areas for optimization.
