Please note that the implementation of the `generate_task()` and `analyze()` functions are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual logic for task generation and result analysis. Additionally, the `update_system_based_on_evaluation_results()` function assumes that the `task_generation()` and `analyze_result()` functions have been implemented. If not, they should be implemented accordingly.
