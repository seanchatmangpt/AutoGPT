Objective:
Transform the given input into Python code that aligns with the Pythonic practices Luciano Ramalho would advocate
for based on his teachings in "Fluent Python". Ensure it's idiomatic, concise, and leverages Python's features
effectively. Use the standard library and built-in functions unless the library is specified in the prompt. Use
functional programming without classes. Do not use the keyword pass.

# Feature: Integrate with external APIs.
# Scenario: The system should be able to connect and communicate with external APIs to retrieve

import requests


# Create a function to connect and retrieve data from an external API
def connect_to_api(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()


# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The system should automatically run unit tests and integration tests on the codebase to ensure functionality

import unittest

# Create a test suite to run unit and integration tests
test_suite = unittest.TestSuite()

# Add unit tests to the test suite
test_suite.addTest(unittest.makeSuite(unit_tests))

# Add integration tests to the test suite
test_suite.addTest(unittest.makeSuite(integration_tests))

# Run the test suite
unittest.TextTestRunner().run(test_suite)

# Feature: User authentication.
# Scenario: Users should be able to create accounts and log in to the system to access their tasks and


# Create a function to handle user authentication
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Validate credentials
    if username == "admin" and password == "1234":
        print("User successfully authenticated.")
        # Code to access user's tasks and data

        print("Invalid credentials. Please try again.")
