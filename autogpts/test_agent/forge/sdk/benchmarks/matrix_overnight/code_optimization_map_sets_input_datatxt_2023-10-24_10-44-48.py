# Feature: Code optimization
# Scenario: The system should analyze the Python source code and suggest optimizations to improve performance and efficiency.

# Using the built-in function "map" to optimize loops
# Using sets to remove duplicate code

# Input data
data = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "d", "e", "f", "g", "g", "h"]

# Using map to optimize loops
optimized_data = list(map(lambda x: x.upper(), data))

# Using sets to remove duplicate code
unique_data = set(optimized_data)

# Feature: Integration with version control systems
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular version control systems such as Git, allowing users to track changes and collaborate on code.

# Using the built-in function "zip" to iterate through multiple lists simultaneously
# Using the library "gitpython" to integrate with Git

# Input data
files = ["main.py", "helper.py", "test.py"]
changes = ["added new function", "fixed bug", "updated test cases"]

# Using zip to iterate through files and changes simultaneously
for file, change in zip(files, changes):
    print(f"Committing {change} to {file}")

# Using gitpython to integrate with Git
import git

# Create a new repository
repo = git.Repo.init("my_project")

# Add files to staging
repo.index.add(files)

# Commit changes
repo.index.commit("Added new feature")

# Feature: Code refactoring and optimization
# Scenario: The system should analyze the Python source code and suggest improvements and optimizations.

# Using the built-in function "filter" to optimize loops
# Using list comprehension to refactor code

# Input data
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using filter to optimize loops
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))

# Using list comprehension to refactor code
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]

# Feature: User authentication
# Scenario: Users should be able to create an account and log in to the system using their credentials.

# Using the built-in function "input" to get user input
# Using the built-in function "getpass" to hide user input

# Get user input
username = input("Enter username: ")
password = getpass.getpass("Enter password: ")

# Check if username and password are correct
if username == "admin" and password == "password":
    print("Login successful!")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials. Please try again.")
