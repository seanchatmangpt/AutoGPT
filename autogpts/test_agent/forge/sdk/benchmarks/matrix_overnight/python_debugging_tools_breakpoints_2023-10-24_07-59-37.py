# Feature: Debugging tools for Python code. Scenario: The system should provide tools for debugging Python code, such as breakpoints

# Set breakpoints using the built-in `breakpoint()` function
# and use the `pdb` debugger to step through code and inspect variables

# Feature: Generate automated test cases. Scenario: The system should analyze the code and generate test cases to cover all possible scenarios

# Use the built-in `unittest` module and its `TestCase` class to write and run automated tests for code
# Utilize third-party libraries such as `coverage` to measure code coverage and generate reports

# Feature: Integration with version control systems. Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with popular version control systems like Git or

# Use the `git` command line interface to interact with the version control system
# or use a third-party library such as `GitPython` to programmatically interact with Git

# Feature: Task tracking and completion. Scenario: The system should allow users to track the progress of tasks and mark them as completed

# Use a task tracking tool such as `Trello` or `JIRA` to manage and track tasks
# or implement a simple task tracking system using dictionaries and lists

# Feature: Collaboration and project management. Scenario: The system should allow for collaboration among team members, including assigning tasks,

# Use a collaborative coding platform such as `GitHub` or `GitLab` to manage code changes and assign tasks to team members
# or use a project management tool such as `Asana` or `Basecamp` to track progress and assign tasks

# Feature: Code optimization suggestions. Scenario: The system should provide suggestions for optimizing code based on performance metrics and reports

# Use third-party libraries such as `pylint` or `flake8` to analyze and suggest improvements for code
# or implement custom functions to measure code complexity and performance

# Feature: Integration with CI/CD pipelines. Scenario: The system should integrate with continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines

# Use a CI/CD platform such as `Jenkins` or `Travis CI` to automatically test and deploy code changes
# or implement custom functions to run tests and deploy code based on specified conditions

# Feature: Automated testing for Python projects. Scenario: The system should be able to run automated tests on Python projects, using

# Utilize the built-in `unittest` module and its `TestLoader` class to discover and run tests for Python projects
# or use third-party libraries such as `pytest` or `nose` for more advanced testing capabilities
