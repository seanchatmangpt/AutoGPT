# Feature: Integration with task management tools

# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular task management tools such as Trello, Asana, etc.

# Use a list to store the task management tools

# Feature: Code completion

# Scenario: The code editor should provide suggestions and auto-completion for code.

# Use the built-in function `input()` to get code input from the user
code = input("Enter code: ")

# Use the built-in function `dir()` to get a list of attributes for the code
suggestions = dir(code)


# Feature: Automated code profiling

# Use the built-in `time` module to measure execution time
import time

    Measures execution time and performance metrics for a given code.

# Feature: Implement data structures in Python

# Use the built-in `list` and `dict` data structures for efficient storage and retrieval of data
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

from collections import deque, defaultdict

my_deque = deque([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
my_defaultdict = defaultdict(int)

# Use the built-in `heapq` module for efficient data sorting and retrieval
import heapq

my_list = [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]
heapq.heapify(my_list)  # convert list to heap
heapq.heappop(my_list)  # pop smallest element from heap

# Use the built-in `array` module for efficient storage and manipulation of homogeneous data
import array

my_array.append(6)  # add element to end of array
my_array.pop(0)  # remove element from beginning of array
