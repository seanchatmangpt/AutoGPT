# Automated code refactoring feature

# It should provide a report with any errors or failures found, and suggest possible solutions to fix them.
# It should also update any related code or queries to reflect the changes made.

# Task categorization feature
# The Task Parsing Engine should categorize tasks based on keywords and phrases in the task description
# This code should be well-structured and adhere to Python coding standards.
# These reports should include code complexity, test coverage, and other relevant performance metrics.
# This will help developers identify areas of improvement and track performance over time.
# These reports should include information on code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks.
