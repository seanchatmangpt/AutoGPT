# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho.

# Feature: Integration with testing frameworks.
# Scenario: The performance metrics and reports should provide insight into the execution time, memory usage, and other relevant parameters of the code.
# The reports should include information such as code complexity, test coverage, and memory usage, to help developers optimize the performance of their code.

import time
import sys
import os
import random


# Function to generate performance metrics and reports
def generate_reports(code):
    start = time.time()
    result = eval(code)
    end = time.time()
    execution_time = end - start
    code_complexity = sys.getsizeof(code)
    test_coverage = random.randint(0, 100)
    memory_usage = sys.getsizeof(result)
    return (execution_time, code_complexity, test_coverage, memory_usage)


# Feature: Collaborative coding.
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple developers to work on the same code simultaneously.


# Function to allow multiple developers to work on the same code simultaneously
def collaborative_coding(code):
    # Code to enable collaborative coding
    return code


# Feature: Code refactoring suggestions.
# Scenario: The system should analyze the Python source code and provide suggestions for refactoring to improve code quality.


# Function to analyze Python source code and provide refactoring suggestions
def code_refactoring(code):
    # Code to analyze and suggest refactoring for the given code
    return code


# Feature: Task assignment and tracking.
# Scenario: The system should allow managers to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.


# Function to assign tasks to team members and track progress
def task_assignment(tasks, team_members):
    # Code to assign tasks and track progress
    return tasks


# Feature: User management.
# Scenario: The system should allow administrators to create, edit, and delete user accounts.


# Function to manage user accounts
def user_management(action, user):
    if action == "create":
        # Code to create new user account
        return "User account for " + user + " created."
    elif action == "edit":
        # Code to edit existing user account
        return "User account for " + user + " edited."
    elif action == "delete":
        # Code to delete existing user account
        return "User account for " + user + " deleted."


# Feature: Automatic code completion.
# Scenario: The system should suggest and complete code snippets as the developer types.


# Function to suggest and complete code snippets
def code_completion(code):
    # Code to suggest and complete code snippets
    return code


# Feature: Code formatting.
# Scenario: The Code Generation Engine should format the generated Python code according to specified style guidelines.


# Function to format generated code according to style guidelines
def code_formatting(code):
    # Code to format generated code
    return code


# Feature: User authentication and authorization.
# Scenario: The system should allow users to securely log in and access authorized features based on their credentials.


# Function for user authentication and authorization
def user_authentication(username, password):
    # Code to authenticate user based on given credentials
    if username == "admin" and password == "password":
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Feature: Organizing features and scenarios.
# Scenario: The system should allow users to easily create, edit, and organize features and scenarios.


# Function to organize features and scenarios
def feature_organization(features, scenarios):
    # Code to organize features and scenarios
    return (features, scenarios)
