# Debugging
# The system should provide a debugger interface for troubleshooting and fixing errors in the Python project.

import pdb

pdb.set_trace()  # insert this line at the location you want to debug in your code

# Automatic code optimization suggestions
# These should include metrics such as code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks.
# These reports should be easily accessible and customizable.

import pycodestyle

pycodestyle.lint(
    file_path
)  # generates a report with code complexity metrics and suggestions for improving readability and structure

# Task organization and prioritization
# The system should allow users to organize and prioritize tasks based on urgency, due date, and other criteria.

tasks = [task1, task2, task3]
sorted_tasks = sorted(
    tasks, key=lambda task: task["due_date"]
)  # sort tasks by due date

# Code completion
# The system should provide code completion suggestions based on the current context and the project's dependencies.

import jedi

jedi.Script(
    code, line, column, path=file_path
)  # returns code completion suggestions for the given code, line, and column

# Collaboration and code review
# It should report any errors or failures in the code and provide suggestions for fixing them.

import pylint

pylint.lint(
    file_path
)  # generates a report with code errors and suggestions for fixing them

# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt,Luciano Ramalho.
