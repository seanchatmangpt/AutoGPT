def clone_repo(repo_url):
    Repo.clone_from(repo_url, "local_repository")  # clone repository to local directory


# Define function to commit and push changes to remote repository
def commit_and_push(repo_path, commit_message):
    repo = Repo(repo_path)
    repo.git.add("--all")  # add all changes to staging area
    repo.index.commit(commit_message)  # commit changes with given commit message
    origin = repo.remote(name="origin")
    origin.push()  # push changes to remote repository


# Feature: Integration with project management tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular project management tools such as Trello, Asana, etc.

# Use Trello API to integrate with Trello boards
# Use requests module to make HTTP requests to Trello API
import requests


# Define function to create a new Trello card on a specified board
def create_trello_card(api_key, api_token, board_id, card_name, card_description):
    url = f"https://api.trello.com/1/cards?key={api_key}&token={api_token}&idList={board_id}&name={card_name}&desc={card_description}"
    response = requests.post(url)
    return (
        response.status_code
    )  # return status code to verify successful creation of card


# Feature: User Authentication
# Scenario: User can sign up for an account

# Use Flask web framework to handle user authentication
from flask import Flask, request, redirect

app = Flask(__name__)


# Define function to handle sign up form submission
@app.route("/signup", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def signup():
    if request.method == "POST":
        # process form data and create user account
        return redirect("/login")  # redirect to login page
    else:
        # display sign up form
        return render_template("signup.html")


# Feature: Integration with version control systems
# Scenario: The system should seamlessly integrate with popular version control systems like Git, SVN

# Use GitPython library to integrate with Git
import git


# Define function to initialize Git repository in current directory
def init_repo():
    repo = git.Repo.init()  # initialize Git repository
    repo.create_remote("origin", "remote_repository_url")  # add remote repository
    return repo


# Feature: Unit testing support
# Scenario: The system should have the ability to support unit testing for Python projects, allowing developers to
# run tests and view results

# Use pytest library for unit testing
# Use subprocess module to run pytest from command line
import subprocess


# Define function to run pytest and return results
def run_pytest():
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["pytest"], capture_output=True
    )  # run pytest and capture output
    return result.stdout  # return results as string


# Feature: Code quality metrics and reports
# Scenario: The system should provide code quality metrics and reports to help developers improve the quality and efficiency of their code

# Use radon library to generate code complexity metrics
# Use coveragepy library to generate code coverage metrics
# Use matplotlib library to plot visualizations of code metrics
import radon
import coverage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Define function to calculate code complexity using radon
def calculate_complexity(module_path):
    complexity = radon.complexity.cc_visit(module_path)  # calculate code complexity
    return complexity  # return list of code complexity metrics for each function


# Define function to calculate code coverage using coveragepy
def calculate_coverage(module_path):
    cov = coverage.Coverage()  # initialize coveragepy object
    cov.start()  # start coverage
    cov.exclude('if __name__ == "__main__"')  # exclude main block from coverage
    exec(open(module_path).read())  # execute module
    cov.stop()  # stop coverage
    cov.save()  # save coverage data
    coverage_report = cov.report()  # generate coverage report
    return coverage_report  # return coverage report as string


# Define function to plot code complexity and code coverage metrics
def plot_metrics(complexity, coverage):
    plt.figure()  # initialize plot
    plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)  # create subplot for code complexity
    plt.plot(complexity)  # plot code complexity metrics
    plt.ylabel("Code complexity")  # label y-axis
    plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)  # create subplot for code coverage
    plt.bar(coverage)  # plot code coverage metrics
    plt.ylabel("Code coverage")  # label y-axis
    plt.show()  # display plot


# Feature: Error handling
# Scenario: When an error occurs, the system should provide helpful error messages and suggest possible solutions

# Use linter to identify and suggest improvements for code readability and maintainability
# Use pylint library to run linter from command line
import subprocess


# Define function to run linter and return suggestions
def run_linter(module_path):
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["pylint", module_path], capture_output=True
    )  # run linter and capture output
    return result.stdout  # return linter suggestions as string


# Define function to automatically identify and suggest changes for code elements
def suggest_changes(module_path):
    # use code analysis libraries such as ast or pycodestyle to identify code elements
    # use regular expressions to suggest changes for identified code elements
    # return suggestions as string
    return suggestions
