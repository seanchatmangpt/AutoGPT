# Feature: Code suggestions
# Scenario: The system should provide suggestions for improving the code and automatically make the changes when approved by the user.


# Possible implementation:
def suggest_improvements(code):
    # Code to analyze the given code and generate suggestions for improvements
    # Returns a list of possible changes
    pass


def apply_changes(code, changes):
    # Code to automatically apply the suggested changes to the given code
    pass


# Feature: User authentication
# Scenario: User logs in with correct credentials


# Possible implementation:
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Code to check if the given username and password match a registered account
    # Returns True if the credentials are correct, False otherwise
    pass


# Feature: Real-time error display
# Scenario: The results should be displayed in real-time to the user for easy identification of errors or bugs.


# Possible implementation:
def display_errors(results):
    # Code to display the errors from the given results in real-time
    pass


# Feature: Debugging tools
# Scenario: The system should provide tools for debugging and testing the Python code, such as a debugger

# Possible implementation:
import pdb


def debug(code):
    # Code to enter the debugger and step through the given code
    pdb.set_trace()
    pass


# Feature: Code structure and best practices
# Scenario: The generated code should follow best practices and be well-structured.

# Possible implementation:
# No specific code needed, but following PEP 8 style guide and using proper naming conventions can help with code structure and best practices.

# Feature: Performance reports
# Scenario: These reports should include information such as execution time, memory usage, and code complexity, and should be available in a user-friendly format.

# Possible implementation:
import time
import memory_profiler
import complexity


def generate_performance_report(code):
    # Code to execute the given code and generate a performance report
    start_time = time.time()
    memory_usage = memory_profiler.memory_usage()
    code_complexity = complexity.calculate(code)
    end_time = time.time()

    # Format the report and display it to the user
    report = f"Execution time: {end_time - start_time} seconds\nMemory usage: {memory_usage} bytes\nCode complexity: {code_complexity}"
    print(report)
    pass


# Feature: Task assignment and tracking
# Scenario: Managers should be able to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.


# Possible implementation:
def assign_task(task, assignee):
    # Code to assign the given task to the specified team member
    pass


def track_progress(task, assignee):
    # Code to track the progress of the given task by the specified team member
    pass


# Feature: Integration with project management tools
# Scenario: The system should allow users to import and export tasks, deadlines, and


# Possible implementation:
def import_tasks_from_tool(tool):
    # Code to import tasks, deadlines, and other information from the specified project management tool
    pass


def export_tasks_to_tool(tool):
    # Code to export tasks, deadlines, and other information to the specified project management tool
    pass
