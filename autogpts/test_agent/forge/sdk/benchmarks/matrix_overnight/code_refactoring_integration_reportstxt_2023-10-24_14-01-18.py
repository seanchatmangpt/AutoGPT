# Code refactoring
# The system should be able to identify and suggest potential code refactoring opportunities to improve the
# system's overall performance and readability.

# Integration with version control systems
# The system should provide detailed reports on any errors or failures encountered during testing.

# Error and exception handling
# The system should handle errors and exceptions in Python code and provide detailed information for developers to identify areas of improvement and track progress over time.

# Integration with code editors and IDEs
# The system should track performance improvements over time and identify areas for optimization, as well as provide suggestions for code improvements and automatically implement them with user approval.

# Real-time collaboration
# The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on the same code in real-time, with changes being synced across all users. It should also provide suggestions for code improvements and automatically implement them with user approval. This should include optimizing code for speed and reducing code duplication.

# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho
# These simulations should leverage Python's built-in functions and standard library to ensure efficient and concise code.
