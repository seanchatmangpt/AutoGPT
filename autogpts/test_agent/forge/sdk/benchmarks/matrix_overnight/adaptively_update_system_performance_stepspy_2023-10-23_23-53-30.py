Feature: Adaptively Update System

Scenario: Evaluate System Performance

Given the system has been running for some time

To manage the state of the system and continuously loop back to task generation,
we can implement the following steps:

1. Use a while loop: One way to continuously loop back to task generation after each
   cycle is to use a while loop in your code.

2. Define the metrics to be collected: The first step in collecting and reporting
   metrics for user performance and skill development is to define the metrics to be
   collected.

3. Identify relevant metrics: The next step is to identify the relevant metrics for
   evaluating user performance and skill development.

Algorithm:

1. Start the evaluation process by defining the task's requirements and the corresponding
   Python code to be evaluated.

2. Collect and report metrics: During the evaluation process, collect and report the
   relevant metrics based on the defined metrics.

3. Analyze the results: Analyze the collected metrics to evaluate the system performance
   and identify areas for improvement.

4. Update the system: Based on the evaluation results, adaptively update the system to
   improve its performance.


The architecture and technologies required to initialize a closed-loop system
for Python coding tasks can be divided into three main components:

1. User Interface for Task Execution:

   - Dashboard: The user interface will have a clean and intuitive dashboard that displays
     relevant information and options for task execution.

   - Interactive Coding Challenges: The system could provide coding challenges and
     exercises for students to practice and test their coding skills.

   - Interactive Code Editor: An interactive code editor where users can write
     and run their own code to practice and test their coding skills.

2. Collecting and Reporting Metrics:

   - Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): The first step in collecting metrics
     for user performance and skill development is to identify the KPIs that are relevant
     to the evaluation process.

   - Personalized Learning Paths: The system could have the option for users to create
     personalized learning paths based on their individual needs and goals.

   - Gamification Elements: Gamification elements such as badges, points, and leaderboards
     can be implemented to motivate users to complete challenges and tasks.

3. Adaptive System Update:

   - Use a state machine: A state machine is a mathematical model used to represent the
     state of a system. It can be used to manage the state of the system and ensure it
     continuously loops back to task generation after each cycle.

   - Use a loop function: Use a loop function in your code that will continuously run the
     task generation process after each cycle.

   - Update Based on Evaluation Results: Based on the evaluation results, adaptively update
     the system to improve its performance.

Architecture:

1. User Interface:

   - Main Screen:
     - Title: Task Execution with AGI Simulations
     - Description: A user-friendly interface for executing and managing tasks within the
       AGI simulation environment.

   - Main Menu:
     - Display options to start a new task, view previous tasks, or exit the system.

   - Interactive Code Editor:
     - An interactive code editor where users can write and run their own code.

2. Task Generation and Management:

   - Task Generator:
     - Generate tasks based on the evaluation results and user preferences.

   - Task Manager:
     - Manage tasks, track progress, and provide feedback to users.

   - Task Executor:
     - Execute tasks and evaluate the results based on predefined metrics.

3. Metrics Collection and Reporting:

   - Metrics Collector:
     - Collect relevant metrics during the evaluation process.

   - Metrics Reporter:
     - Report the collected metrics and provide visualizations for easy analysis.

   - Performance Dashboard:
     - Display the performance metrics in a user-friendly dashboard for easy monitoring
       and analysis.

Algorithm:

1. Start by defining the task requirements as a list of steps or objectives.

2. Create a function that takes in the code to be evaluated and the task requirements as arguments.

3. Execute the code using the function and check if it meets the task requirements.

4. Collect the relevant metrics based on the defined metrics.

5. Analyze the collected metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the training program or
   the user's performance.

6. Update the system based on the evaluation results to improve its performance.
