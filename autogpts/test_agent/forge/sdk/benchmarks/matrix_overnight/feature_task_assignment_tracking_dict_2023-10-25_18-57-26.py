# Feature: Task assignment and tracking.
# Scenario: The system should allow for tasks to be assigned to specific team members and track their progress.

# Create a dictionary to store task assignments and their corresponding team members
task_assignments = {'Task 1': 'Team Member A', 'Task 2': 'Team Member B', 'Task 3': 'Team Member C'}

# Function to track the progress of a specific task
def track_progress(task):
    if task in task_assignments:
        print("Task", task, "is currently assigned to", task_assignments[task])
    else:
        print("Task", task, "has not been assigned yet.")

# Display progress of tasks
for task in task_assignments:
    track_progress(task)

# Feature: Collaboration and team management.
# Scenario: The system should provide detailed results and suggestions for fixing any errors or failures.

# Function to handle errors or failures and provide suggestions
def handle_errors(errors):
    if len(errors) == 0:
        print("No errors or failures found.")
        return

    # Display error messages and suggestions for fixing them
    for error in errors:
        print("Error:", error, "- Suggested fix:", fix_error(error))

# Function to fix a specific error
def fix_error(error):
    # Logic to fix error
    return "Fix for " + error

# Sample list of errors found
errors = ["SyntaxError", "TypeError", "NameError"]

# Display error handling results
handle_errors(errors)

# Feature: Code debugging.
# Scenario: The system should allow users to debug their Python code, step through it, and identify bugs.

# Function to debug code
def debug_code(code):
    # Logic for debugging code
    return "Debugged code"

# Sample code to debug
code = "print('Hello, world!')"

# Display debugged code
print(debug_code(code))

# Feature: Real-time collaboration.
# Scenario: Multiple users should be able to collaborate on the same Python project in real-time.

# Utilizing Git and a code collaboration platform like GitHub, multiple users can collaborate on the same Python project in real-time.

# Feature: Debugging capabilities.
# Scenario: The IDE should provide advanced debugging features, such as breakpoints, step-through execution, and variable inspection.

# Utilizing an IDE like PyCharm, users can set breakpoints, step through code execution, and inspect variables for debugging purposes.

# Feature: Code refactoring suggestions.
# Scenario: The Code Refactoring Engine should analyze the Python source code and suggest improvements or optimizations.

# Function to analyze code and suggest refactoring
def suggest_refactoring(code):
    # Logic to analyze code and suggest changes
    return "Refactored code"

# Sample code to refactor
code = "x = 2 + 3"

# Display refactored code
print(suggest_refactoring(code))

# Feature: Real-time code performance monitoring.
# Scenario: The system should continuously track the execution time of each function in the Python code.

# Using a performance monitoring tool like PyPerformance, the system can continuously track the execution time of each function in the Python code.
