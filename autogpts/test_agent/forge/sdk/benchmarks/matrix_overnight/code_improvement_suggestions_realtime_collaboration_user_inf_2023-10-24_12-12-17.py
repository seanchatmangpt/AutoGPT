# Code Improvement Suggestions

# Feature: Real-time collaboration
# Scenario: Enable multiple users to collaborate on the same task in real-time

# Use a dictionary to store user information
users = {
    "John": {"id": 1, "username": "John123", "email": "john@gmail.com"},
    "Jane": {"id": 2, "username": "Jane456", "email": "jane@gmail.com"},
    "Tom": {"id": 3, "username": "Tom789", "email": "tom@gmail.com"},
}

# Use a list to store tasks
tasks = [
    {"task_id": 1, "name": "Task 1", "assigned_to": "John", "status": "In Progress"},
    {"task_id": 2, "name": "Task 2", "assigned_to": "Jane", "status": "In Progress"},
    {"task_id": 3, "name": "Task 3", "assigned_to": "Tom", "status": "In Progress"},
]

# Feature: Implement error handling in Python code
# Scenario: Add try/catch blocks to handle errors

# Use a try/except block to handle potential errors
try:
    # Code that may result in an error
    result = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Handle the error
    print("Cannot divide by zero")

# Given a database schema, generate Python code to interact with the database
# This will allow developers to easily access data from the database

# Use the built-in sqlite3 library to interact with the database
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query to retrieve data from the database
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")

# Use a for loop to iterate through the results
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row)

# Feature: Integration with code review tools
# Scenario: Generate reports on code coverage, complexity, and performance

# Use a code coverage tool, such as coverage.py, to measure code coverage
# Use a code complexity tool, such as radon, to measure code complexity
# Use a performance testing tool, such as pytest-benchmark, to measure code performance

# Code Refactoring Suggestions

# Feature: Collaboration and project management
# Scenario: Allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously

# Use a version control system, such as Git, to manage code changes
# Use a project management tool, such as Trello, to track tasks and progress

# Feature: Continuous Integration and Delivery
# Scenario: Generate reports on any errors or failures encountered during the testing process

# Use a continuous integration tool, such as Jenkins, to automatically run tests
# Use a logging tool, such as Loguru, to track errors and failures during testing


# Use functions for code refactoring
def generate_report(report_type):
    # Generate a report of the specified type
    if report_type == "coverage":
        # Use coverage.py to measure code coverage
        # Return the coverage report
        return coverage_report
    elif report_type == "complexity":
        # Use radon to measure code complexity
        # Return the complexity report
        return complexity_report
    elif report_type == "performance":
        # Use pytest-benchmark to measure code performance
        # Return the performance report
        return performance_report
