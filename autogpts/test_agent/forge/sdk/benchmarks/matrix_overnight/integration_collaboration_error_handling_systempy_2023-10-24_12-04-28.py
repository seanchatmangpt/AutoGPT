# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Feature: Collaboration and version control.
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on a Python project and provide

# Feature: Error handling.
# Scenario: The system should handle errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages for developers to debug their code.

# Feature: Integration with testing frameworks.
# Scenario: The system should provide detailed reports on any errors or failures encountered during the testing process.

# These reports should include code complexity, test coverage, and other performance metrics.

# Feature: Automatic code optimization.
# These reports should provide insights into the performance of the code, such as execution time, memory usage, and code complexity.

# Feature: Task assignment and tracking.
# Scenario: The system should allow for tasks to be assigned to specific team members and track their progress.

# Feature: Collaboration tools for remote teams.
# Scenario: The system should provide features such as real-time communication, file sharing, and task management for remote teams.

# Feature: User authentication.
# Scenario: Users should be able to create an account and login to the system securely.
