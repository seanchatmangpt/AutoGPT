# Automated task assignment
# The system should assign tasks to team members based on their availability and skill set.

# Debugging capabilities
# This includes generating the basic structure of the Python code, including appropriate imports and function definitions.

# Code generation engine
# Given a database schema, the system should generate Python code to interact with the database.

# The Code Generation Engine should provide the user with a report of the changes made and allow them to review and approve the changes before implementing them. It should also provide suggestions for improving code readability and maintainability.

# Comprehensive testing report
# The system should provide a comprehensive report of any errors or failures encountered during the testing process and suggest ways to fix them.

# Support for multiple programming languages
# The system should be able to display metrics and reports in a user-friendly format. This will allow developers to identify areas for improvement and track the impact of optimizations on code performance. The reports should include information such as code complexity, code coverage, and execution time.

# Performance reports
# These reports should include information such as code complexity, execution time, memory usage, and other relevant performance metrics.
