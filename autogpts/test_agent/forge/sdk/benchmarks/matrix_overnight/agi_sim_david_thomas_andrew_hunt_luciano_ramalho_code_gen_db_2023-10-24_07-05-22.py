# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho.

# Code Generation Engine should generate Python code to interact with the database
# using the given database schema.

# Detailed reports on any errors or failures found in the code should be provided.

# Real-time collaboration should be enabled for multiple users to work on the same code.

# Integration with external tools and libraries should be supported, with performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, and code complexity included.

# Integration with development tools should also be supported, with metrics such as code complexity, code coverage, and code duplication, as well as recommendations for improving performance.

# Error handling should be implemented, with graceful handling and helpful error messages provided.

# User authentication and authorization should be supported, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and restrict access to certain features.
