# Feature: Task assignment and tracking.
# Scenario: The system should allow for tasks to be assigned to team members and track their
# progress.

# Use a dictionary to store tasks assigned to team members.
tasks = {
    "David": {"Task 1": "In Progress", "Task 2": "Completed", "Task 3": "Not Started"},
    "Andrew": {"Task 1": "Completed", "Task 2": "In Progress", "Task 3": "Completed"},
    "Luciano": {
        "Task 1": "Not Started",
        "Task 2": "Not Started",
        "Task 3": "In Progress",
    },
}


# Use a function to update the status of a task.
def update_task_status(team_member, task, status):
    tasks[team_member][task] = status


# Example of updating task status:
update_task_status("David", "Task 3", "In Progress")

# Feature: Collaborative code editing.
# Scenario: Multiple users should be able to edit the same code simultaneously, with changes being
# synced in real-time.


# Use the built-in `zip` function to iterate over two lists simultaneously.
# Use a generator expression to return a list of tuples with the original and updated code.
def sync_code_changes(old_code, updated_code):
    return [(old_line, new_line) for old_line, new_line in zip(old_code, updated_code)]


# Example of syncing code changes:
old_code = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
updated_code = [1, 2, 6, 4, 5]
synced_changes = sync_code_changes(old_code, updated_code)
print(synced_changes)  # Output: [(3, 6)]

# Feature: User authentication.
# Scenario: The system should allow users to create accounts and log in with a username and password for
# authentication.

# Use the `getpass` function from the `getpass` module to securely get user input for password.
import getpass

# Use a dictionary to store user credentials.
users = {"David": "password1", "Andrew": "password2", "Luciano": "password3"}


# Use a function to authenticate user login.
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    if username in users and users[username] == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Example of user authentication:
username = input("Enter your username: ")
password = getpass.getpass("Enter your password: ")
if authenticate_user(username, password):
    print("Login successful!")
else:
    print("Incorrect credentials.")

# Feature: Debugging tool for Python code.
# Scenario: The system should provide a debugging tool that allows users to step through
# code and track variable values.

# Use the `pdb` module to provide a debugging tool.
import pdb


# Use the `set_trace` function to set a breakpoint.
def divide(x, y):
    pdb.set_trace()
    return x / y


# Example of using the debugging tool:
divide(
    10, 0
)  # Program execution will pause at the breakpoint and allow for variable tracking.

# Scenario: Given a database schema and a table, the system should generate code for basic CRUD operations on that table.
# Scenario: The results of the tests should be displayed to the user.

# Use the `sqlalchemy` library to generate code for basic CRUD operations.
import sqlalchemy

# Use the `inspect` function to get information about the database table.
from sqlalchemy import inspect


# Use a function to generate code for basic CRUD operations.
def generate_crud(table_name):
    inspector = inspect(sqlalchemy.create_engine("sqlite:///database.db"))
    columns = inspector.get_columns(table_name)
    code = ""
    for column in columns:
        code += f"{column['name']} = Column({column['type']})\n"

    return code


# Example of generating CRUD code for a table named 'users':
crud_code = generate_crud("users")
print(
    crud_code
)  # Output: id = Column(Integer), name = Column(String), email = Column(String)

# Feature: Collaboration and team management.
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to work on the same project and track their contributions.

# Use the `git` library to manage project collaboration and track contributions.
import git

# Use the `Repo` class to initialize a git repository.
repo = git.Repo.init("project_folder")

# Use the `commit` function to commit changes to the repository.
repo.commit("Changes made by David")

# Feature: Code review and collaboration.
# Scenario: The results of the tests and debugging should be displayed to the user.

# Use the `pytest` library to run tests and display results.
import pytest


# Use the `set_trace` function from the `pdb` module to set a breakpoint in the code.
def divide(x, y):
    pdb.set_trace()
    return x / y


# Use the `pytest` function to run tests and display results.
def test_divide():
    assert divide(10, 2) == 5


# Example of running and displaying test results:
test_divide()  # Output: test_divide.py:4: AssertionError

# Feature: Code refactoring.
# Scenario: The system should be able to analyze code and provide suggestions for refactoring.

# Use the `pylint` library to analyze code and provide suggestions for refactoring.
import pylint

# Use the `run` function to run the linter on a file.
pylint.run("code_file.py")

# Feature: Integration with debugging tools.
# Scenario: The system should provide detailed reports on any errors or failures encountered during testing.

# Use the `pytest` library to run tests and generate a report.
import pytest


# Use the `set_trace` function from the `pdb` module to set a breakpoint in the code.
def divide(x, y):
    pdb.set_trace()
    return x / y


# Use the `pytest` function to run tests and generate a report.
def test_divide():
    assert divide(10, 0) == 5


# Example of running tests and generating a report:
pytest.main(
    ["-v", "--pdb"]
)  # Output: test_divide.py:4: Failed: assert divide(10, 0) == 5

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should have the ability to integrate with popular version control systems such as
# Git, SVN, and Mercurial.

# Use the `git` library to integrate with Git.
import git

repo = git.Repo("project_folder")

# Use the `git` function to add files to the staging area.
repo.git.add("file.py")

# Use the `commit` function to commit changes to the repository.
repo.commit("Changes made by David")

# Use the `push` function to push changes to the remote repository.
repo.git.push()
