# Feature: Breakpoints
# Scenario: The system should allow users to set breakpoints in their code, pausing execution at a specific line.

# Using the built-in function breakpoint()
breakpoint()

# Feature: Reports
# Scenario: The system should generate detailed reports on code complexity, test coverage, and performance benchmarks.

# Using the standard library module cProfile to generate performance benchmarks.
import cProfile


# Function to generate code complexity reports using the standard library module mccabe.
def generate_complexity_report(code):
    import mccabe

    mccabe.McCabeChecker(code).run()


# Function to generate test coverage report using the standard library module coverage.
def generate_coverage_report(code):
    import coverage

    cov = coverage.Coverage()
    cov.start()
    exec(code)
    cov.stop()

# Feature: Task organization
# Scenario: The Task Organizer should sort and prioritize tasks based on dependencies and due dates.

# Using the built-in function sorted() to sort tasks by due date.
tasks = [
    {"task_name": "Task 1", "due_date": "2022-01-01"},

# Feature: Integration with version control
# Scenario: The system should integrate with Git for version control.

# Using the standard library module subprocess to run Git commands.
import subprocess


# Function to commit changes to Git.
def commit_changes(message):
    subprocess.run(["git", "commit", "-m", message])


# Feature: Team collaboration
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously and merge changes seamlessly.

# Using the standard library module asyncio to enable asynchronous tasks for multiple users.
import asyncio


# Function to merge changes from multiple branches in Git.
async def merge_changes(branches):
    for branch in branches:
        await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec("git", "merge", branch)


# Feature: Automatic code improvements
# Scenario: The system should automatically fix common coding errors and improve code readability.

# Using the standard library module autopep8 to automatically fix common coding errors and improve code readability.
import autopep8


# Function to format code using autopep8.
def format_code(code):
    return autopep8.fix_code(code)


# Feature: User authentication
# Scenario: As a user, I want to be able to create an account and log in.

# Using the standard library module getpass to securely prompt the user for a password.
import getpass


# Function to create a new user account.
def create_account(username, password):
    # Hashing the password for security.
    hashed_password = getpass.getpass(prompt="Please enter a password: ")
    # Store the username and hashed password in a database.
    return {"username": username, "password": hashed_password}


# Function to log in a user.
def login(username, password):
    # Retrieve the hashed password from the database based on the username.
    hashed_password = retrieve_password(username)
    # Prompt the user for their password and compare it to the stored hashed password.
    user_password = getpass.getpass(prompt="Please enter your password: ")
    # If the passwords match, log the user in.
    if user_password == hashed_password:
