# This script is an example of how the AGI simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, and Luciano Ramalho would
# run and how they would interact with each other to ensure high quality and efficient code.

# Feature: Test coverage analysis
# Scenario: The system should analyze the test coverage of the Python project and provide feedback on areas that
# need improvement.

# The system should be able to generate reports on code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks.

# Import necessary libraries
import coverage
import performance

# Create coverage object
cov = coverage.Coverage()

# Start coverage
cov.start()

# Run code to be tested
my_function()

# Stop coverage
cov.stop()

# Generate report
cov.report()

# Feature: Integration with project management tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular project management tools such as Trello or JIRA

# Import necessary library
import trello

# Create Trello object
trello = trello.Trello()

# Connect to Trello board
trello.connect(board_id)

# Get list of tasks
tasks = trello.get_tasks()

# Feature: Collaboration and team management
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously and manage

# Import necessary library
import collaboration

# Create collaboration object
collab = collaboration.Collaboration()

# Connect to project
collab.connect(project_id)

# Add team members
collab.add_team_members(team_members)

# Feature: Code review suggestions
# Scenario: After scanning the code for vulnerabilities, the system should suggest specific code changes or best practices

# Import necessary libraries
import vulnerability_scan
import code_suggestions

# Create vulnerability scanner object
vuln_scan = vulnerability_scan.VulnerabilityScanner()

# Scan code for vulnerabilities
vuln_scan.scan(my_code)

# Create code suggestions object
code_sugg = code_suggestions.CodeSuggestions()

# Get suggestions for code improvements
suggestions = code_sugg.get_suggestions(vuln_scan)

# Feature: Automated task assignment
# Scenario: The system should be able to automatically assign tasks to team members based on their skills

# Import necessary library
import skill_matching

# Create skill matching object
skill_match = skill_matching.SkillMatching()

# Get list of team members and their skills
team_members = skill_match.get_team_members()

# Get list of tasks
tasks = skill_match.get_tasks()

# Automatically assign tasks to team members based on skills
skill_match.assign_tasks(team_members, tasks)

# Feature: Automated unit testing
# Scenario: The system should have the capability to automatically run unit tests on code to ensure proper functionality

# Import necessary library
import unit_testing

# Create unit testing object
unit_test = unit_testing.UnitTesting()

# Run unit tests on code
unit_test.run(my_code)

# Check for failures
failures = unit_test.get_failures()

# Feature: Automated testing
# Scenario: The automated testing module should run all Gherkin scenarios and report any failures.

# Import necessary libraries
import gherkin_scenarios
import automated_testing

# Create Gherkin scenarios object
gherkin = gherkin_scenarios.GherkinScenarios()

# Get list of scenarios
scenarios = gherkin.get_scenarios()

# Create automated testing object
automated_test = automated_testing.AutomatedTesting()

# Run automated tests on scenarios
automated_test.run(scenarios)

# Report any failures
failures = automated_test.get_failures()
