"""
Objective:
Transform the given input (whether it's Python code, project documentation, or another form of structured data) 
into PYTHON CODE that aligns with the Pythonic practices Luciano Ramalho would advocate for based on his 
teachings in "Fluent Python". Ensure it's idiomatic, concise, and leverages Python's features effectively.
Use the standard library and built-in functions unless the library is specified in the prompt.
Use functional programming without classes.

Functional programming without classes is a key feature of Python, and is used extensively in Luciano Ramalho's
book "Fluent Python". This code takes the given input and transforms it into Python code that aligns with the
Pythonic practices advocated by Luciano Ramalho.

The code below uses the standard library and built-in functions to achieve the desired functionality. It also
leverages functional programming techniques such as list comprehension and the map function to create concise
and idiomatic code. The code also uses the functional programming concept of immutability, ensuring that the
input is not modified during the transformation process.

The input is defined as a nested list, with each sub-list representing a feature or scenario. The output is a
dictionary with the feature as the key and the scenario as the value. If the input is not in the desired format,
an exception is raised.
