# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The system should have the ability to run automated tests on the code and report any failures.
# This includes removing redundant code, optimizing loops, and improving variable names.
# It should also provide detailed reports on any errors or failures encountered during the process.

# Add error handling to the system.
# If an error occurs during the execution of a task, the system should handle it appropriately.

# Feature: Task assignment and tracking.
# Scenario: The system should allow managers to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.

# Feature: Integration with continuous integration systems.
# This can include data such as execution time, memory usage, and code complexity.

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.

# These metrics and reports should include information such as code complexity, code coverage, and code quality.
