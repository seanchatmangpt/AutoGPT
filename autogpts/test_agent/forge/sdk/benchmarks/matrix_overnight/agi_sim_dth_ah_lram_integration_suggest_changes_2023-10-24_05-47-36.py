# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt,Luciano Ramahlo.

# Feature: Integration with bug tracking systems
# Scenario: The system should automatically suggest changes to the code and allow the user to apply them with a single click.


def suggest_changes(code):
    # function for suggesting changes to the code
    return suggested_changes


def apply_changes(code):
    # function for applying changes with a single click
    return modified_code


# Feature: Code formatting
# Scenario: The system should automatically format the Python code according to the standard coding conventions.

import autopep8


def format_code(code):
    # function for automatically formatting code according to PEP8 standards
    return autopep8.fix_code(code)


# Feature: Code refactoring
# Scenario: The system should be able to accurately parse natural language descriptions and translate them into specific tasks that can be executed by the system.

import ast


def parse_description(description):
    # function for parsing natural language descriptions into executable tasks
    parsed_description = ast.parse(description)
    return parsed_description


# Feature: Automated code review
# Scenario: The system should automatically review the Python source code for best practices, coding standards, and provide a preview of the changes before applying them.

import pylint


def review_code(code):
    # function for automatically reviewing code for best practices and coding standards
    pylint.run(["--reports=n", code])
    return pylint.lint(code)


# Feature: Integration with project management tools
# Scenario: The system should be able to sync task items with project management tools such as JIRA or Trello.


def sync_tasks(project_management_tool, tasks):
    # function for syncing tasks with project management tools
    project_management_tool.sync(tasks)
    return synced_tasks


# Feature: Implement error handling and logging
# Scenario: The system should handle errors and exceptions in the Python code and log them.

import logging


def handle_errors(code):
    # function for handling errors and exceptions in code
    try:
        exec(code)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(str(e))


# Feature: Integration with continuous integration tools
# Scenario: The system should generate reports on code complexity, test coverage, and code quality.

import coverage


def generate_reports(code):
    # function for generating reports on code complexity, test coverage, and code quality
    coverage.process_startup()
    coverage.load()
    coverage.start()
    exec(code)
    coverage.stop()
    coverage.combine()
    coverage.report()


# Feature: Integration with version control systems
# Scenario: The system should generate reports on code coverage, execution time, memory usage, and other relevant performance metrics.

import git


def generate_version_control_reports(code):
    # function for generating reports on code coverage, execution time, memory usage, and other relevant performance metrics
    repo = git.Repo(".")
    # execute code and gather performance metrics
    repo.git.add(".")
    repo.git.commit("-m", "Performance metrics")
    repo.git.push()
    # generate report using performance metrics gathered from code execution
    report = generate_report()
    return report


# Feature: Code optimization
def optimize_code(code):
    # function for optimizing code to improve performance and efficiency
    optimized_code = optimize(code)
    return optimized_code
