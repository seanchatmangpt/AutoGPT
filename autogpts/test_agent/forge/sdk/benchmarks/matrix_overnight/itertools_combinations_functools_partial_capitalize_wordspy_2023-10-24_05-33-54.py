# Feature: Collaboration and team management. Scenario: The system should allow
# multiple users to collaborate on a project, assign tasks,
# and generate reports on the test results and provide suggestions for improvements.

# Feature: Code collaboration and version control. Scenario: The system should
# allow users to collaborate on code and track changes using version control.

# Using a version control system like Git is the ideal solution for this feature.


# Feature: Debugging tools. Scenario: The system should provide debugging tools
# to help identify and fix any errors or bugs in the code.

# Using the built-in debugger in Python or a third-party library like pdb would be a good solution for this feature.


# Feature: Code formatting. Scenario: The system should automatically format
# the generated Python code according to PEP8 guidelines.

# Using a code formatter like Black or autopep8 would be a great solution for this feature.


# Feature: Integration with testing tools. Scenario: The system should
# integrate with testing tools to provide metrics and reports on code quality,
# code coverage, and performance.


class TestRunner:
    def __init__(self, code):
        self.code = code

    def run_tests(self):
        # run tests and return results

    def get_code_quality(self):
        # calculate code quality metrics
        pass

    def get_code_coverage(self):
        # calculate code coverage metrics
        pass

    def get_performance_metrics(self):
        # calculate performance metrics
        pass


# Feature: Implement data caching for improved performance. Scenario: The system
# should cache frequently used data to reduce processing time and improve
# overall performance.

# Using a caching library like Redis or Memcached would be a great solution for this feature.


# Feature: User-friendly GUI. Scenario: The system should have a user-friendly
# graphical interface for easy navigation and interaction with the code.

# Using a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt would be a great solution for this feature.
