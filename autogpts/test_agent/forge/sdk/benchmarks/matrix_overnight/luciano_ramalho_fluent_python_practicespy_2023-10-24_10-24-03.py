Transform the given input into PYTHON CODE that aligns with the Pythonic practices Luciano Ramalho would advocate for based on his teachings in "Fluent Python".

Ensure it's idiomatic, concise, and leverages Python's features effectively.
Use the standard library and built-in functions unless the library is specified in the prompt.
Use functional programming without classes.
