# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho

# Feature: Automatic code formatting.
# Scenario: The system should automatically format the generated code according to
# common Python coding conventions and standards.

# Use the built-in function 'format' to automatically format the code according to PEP 8 style.
# This function takes in the code as a string and returns the formatted code.

formatted_code = format(code, "pep8")

# Feature: User Authentication.
# Scenario: When a user attempts to log in with valid credentials, the system should authenticate the user.

# Use the 'auth' library to handle user authentication.
# The 'authenticate' function takes in the user's credentials as parameters and returns a boolean value
# indicating whether the user is authenticated or not.

from auth import authenticate

user = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

if authenticate(user, password):
    print("User authenticated.")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials.")

# Feature: Generate automated reports.
# Scenario: The system should be able to generate reports based on user-defined parameters and data inputs.

# Use the built-in function 'report' to generate reports based on user-defined parameters and data inputs.
# This function takes in the parameters and data inputs as arguments and returns the report.

report = generate_report(param1, param2, data1, data2)

# Feature: Task assignment.
# Scenario: The system should assign tasks to team members based on their availability, skills, and workload.

# Use the 'task' library to handle task assignment.
# The 'assign_task' function takes in the team members' availability, skills, and workload as parameters
# and assigns a task to the most suitable team member.

from task import assign_task

task = get_task()
team_members = get_team_members()

assign_task(task, team_members)

# Feature: Code testing and debugging.
# Scenario: The system should test and debug the code and provide feedback on any errors or failures encountered.

# Use the built-in 'unittest' library for testing and debugging.
# The 'TestCase' class provides methods for testing code and the 'assert' statement can be used to check for errors.

import unittest


class CodeTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_function(self):
        result = my_function()
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)


unittest.main()

# Feature: Update documentation and comments.
# Scenario: The system should update any associated documentation and comments to reflect changes made to the code.

# Use the built-in 'docstrings' feature to document the code.
# This allows for easy updating of documentation and comments when changes are made to the code.


def my_function():
    """
    This function does something.
    """
    # Code goes here
    pass


# Feature: Performance monitoring.
# Scenario: The system should provide insights into the performance of the code, such as execution time, memory usage, and any potential bottlenecks.

# Use the 'profile' library to monitor code performance.
# The 'run' function can be used to execute code and the 'print_stats' method can be used to print performance metrics.

import profile

profile.run("my_function()")
profile.print_stats()

# Feature: Code quality reports.
# Scenario: The system should generate reports on code quality metrics such as code complexity, code coverage, and runtime performance.

# Use the 'coverage' library to generate code coverage reports.
# The 'run' function can be used to execute code and the 'report' method can be used to generate a report on code coverage.

import coverage

coverage.run("my_function()")
coverage.report()

# Use the 'pylint' library to generate code quality reports.
# The 'run' function can be used to execute code and the 'lint' method can be used to generate a report on code complexity and style.

import pylint

pylint.run("my_function()")
pylint.lint()
