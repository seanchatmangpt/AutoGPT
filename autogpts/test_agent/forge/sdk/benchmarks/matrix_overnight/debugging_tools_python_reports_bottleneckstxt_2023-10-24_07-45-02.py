# Debugging tools for Python code
# The system should provide detailed reports on any failures or errors encountered
# during the process.
# This should include information such as lines of code, code complexity, and test
# coverage.
# This will help developers in identifying potential bottlenecks and optimizing
# the code for better performance.
# These metrics may include code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks.
# The reports should be easily accessible and customizable.

# Task assignment and tracking
# Users should be able to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.

# Collaboration tools for team projects
# The system should have features such as shared document editing, task assignment,
# and real-time communication.

# The system should automatically run tests on the Python code to ensure
# functionality and identify potential bugs.

# Data visualization
# The system should provide visualizations of data from the Python project,
