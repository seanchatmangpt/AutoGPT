# Feature: Automated testing and deployment.
# Scenario: The system should have a testing framework in place to automatically test code changes and deploy.

# Import necessary libraries
import unittest
import os


# Define a testing class
class TestCodeChanges(unittest.TestCase):
    # Define test methods
    def test_code_changes(self):
        code_changes = True
        self.assertTrue(code_changes)

    def test_deploy(self):
        deploy = True
        self.assertTrue(deploy)


# Run the tests
unittest.main()

# Feature: Collaboration tools for remote teams.
# Scenario: The system should provide tools for remote teams to collaborate on code, such as

# Import necessary libraries
import socket

# Define a socket connection for remote collaboration
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8080
s.connect((host, port))

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with popular version control systems like Git.

# Import necessary libraries
import git
from git import Repo

# Define a Git repository
repo = Repo(path_to_repo)
assert not repo.bare

# Feature: Advanced debugging tools.
# Scenario: The system should provide advanced debugging tools such as step-by-step execution, breakpoints, etc.

# Import necessary libraries
import pdb

# Set breakpoints and use step-by-step execution
a = 1
b = 2
pdb.set_trace()
c = a + b
print(c)

# Feature: Debugging tools for Python code.
# Scenario: The system should provide debugging tools such as breakpoints, step-by-step, etc.

# Import necessary libraries
import pdb


# Set breakpoints and use step-by-step execution
def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2


pdb.run("add(1, 2)")

# Feature: Syntax highlighting.
# Scenario: The system should have the ability to highlight different parts of the Python code in different colors.

# This functionality is already provided by most code editors and IDEs.

# Feature: Integration with testing tools.
# Scenario: The system should produce reports with code complexity, code coverage, and code quality measures.

# Import necessary libraries
import unittest
import coverage
import pylint


# Define a testing class
class TestCodeQuality(unittest.TestCase):
    # Define test methods
    def test_code_complexity(self):
        code_complexity = True
        self.assertTrue(code_complexity)

    def test_code_coverage(self):
        code_coverage = True
        self.assertTrue(code_coverage)

    def test_code_quality(self):
        code_quality = True
        self.assertTrue(code_quality)


# Generate reports using coverage and pylint
cov = coverage.Coverage()
cov.start()
unittest.main()
cov.stop()
cov.report()
pylint.run(["file1.py", "file2.py"])

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should produce reports with execution time, memory usage, and line-by-line performance analysis.

# Import necessary libraries
import git
from git import Repo
import time
import memory_profiler
import line_profiler

# Define a Git repository
repo = Repo(path_to_repo)
assert not repo.bare


# Define a function to test performance
@profile
def test_performance():
    for i in range(1000000):
        pass


# Run the function and generate reports
test_performance()
time.sleep(5)
mem_usage = memory_profiler.memory_usage()
print("Memory usage:", mem_usage[0])
lp = line_profiler.LineProfiler()
lp_wrapper = lp(test_performance)
