# Fluent Python is all about leveraging the language's features and using idiomatic code to write
# concise and readable code. With that in mind, let's use the powerful list comprehension and
# built-in functions to create a list of dictionaries from the given prompt. 

# First, we'll create a list of features, each represented as a dictionary with its corresponding
# scenario and other information.

features = [
    {
        'name': 'Task assignment and tracking',
        'scenario': 'Managers should be able to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.',
        'details': [
            'The system should also provide feedback on any errors or failures in the code.',
            'It should provide detailed reports on any errors or failures encountered during the testing process.'
        ]
    },
    {
        'name': 'User authentication',
        'scenario': 'Given a user''s login credentials, the system should verify the user''s identity and grant access.',
        'details': []
    },
    {
        'name': 'Automatic error detection and debugging',
        'scenario': 'The system should automatically detect and debug errors in the Python code to improve its performance.',
        'details': []
    },
    {
        'name': 'Integration with version control',
        'scenario': 'The system should allow for easy integration with popular version control systems such as Git, SVN, etc.',
        'details': []
    },
    {
        'name': 'Code formatting',
        'scenario': 'The system should format generated code according to the PEP 8 style guide.',
        'details': [
            'Error reports should include code complexity, code coverage, and execution time.'
        ]
    },
    {
        'name': 'Performance comparison',
        'scenario': 'This feature should also have the capability to compare performance metrics between different versions of the code.',
        'details': [
            'The reports should include information such as execution time, memory usage, and other performance indicators.',
            'The reports should include information such as code complexity, code coverage, and potential performance bottlenecks.'
        ]
    },
    {
        'name': 'Integration with local databases',
        'scenario': 'The system should allow the user to view the performance of their code and identify areas for improvement.',

    }
]

# Now, let's use the map function to create a list of formatted strings for each feature.

formatted_features = list(map(lambda feature: 'Feature: {}. Scenario: {}'.format(feature['name'], feature['scenario']), features))

# Finally, we can print out the list of formatted strings to see our results.

print(formatted_features)

# Output:
# ['Feature: Task assignment and tracking. Scenario: Managers should be able to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.',
# 'Feature: User authentication. Scenario: Given a users login credentials, the system should verify the users identity and grant access.',
# 'Feature: Automatic error detection and debugging. Scenario: The system should automatically detect and debug errors in the Python code to improve its performance.',
# 'Feature: Integration with version control. Scenario: The system should allow for easy integration with popular version control systems such as Git, SVN, etc.',
# 'Feature: Code formatting. Scenario: The system should format generated code according to the PEP 8 style guide.',
