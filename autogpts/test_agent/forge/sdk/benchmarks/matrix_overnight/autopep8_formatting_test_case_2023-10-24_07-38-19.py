# Feature: Automatic code formatting.
# Scenario: The system should automatically format the generated Python code
# according to PEP 8 guidelines.

# This feature is already supported by the autopep8 library,
# so we just need to import it and run it on the generated code.
import autopep8

# Feature: Integration with third-party testing tools.
# Scenario: This will allow users to track the performance of their code over time
# and identify areas for improvement.

# We can use the coverage and pytest libraries to generate reports
# on code complexity, coverage, and performance metrics.

import coverage
import pytest

# Feature: Code Refactoring.
# Scenario: This includes renaming variables, extracting reusable code into functions,
# and optimizing algorithms.

# We can use the refactoring functionality from the rope library
# to automatically refactor code according to best practices.

import rope

# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The system should automatically run unit tests on the code.

# We can use the unittest library to automatically run unit tests on the code.

import unittest

# Feature: Code Complexity Reporting.
# Scenario: The system should provide reports on code complexity.

# We can use the radon library to generate reports on code complexity.

import radon

# Feature: Version control integration.
# Scenario: The system should support integration with version control systems
# such as Git, allowing for easy collaboration.

# We can use the GitPython library to interact with Git and handle version control.

import git

# Feature: Task assignment to team members.
# Scenario: The system should allow project managers to assign tasks to specific team members.

# We can use the task management functionality from the Trello API
# to allow project managers to assign tasks to team members.

import trello

# Feature: Automated error reporting.
# Scenario: The system should provide a detailed report on any errors or failures encountered during the testing process.

# We can use the unittest library to automatically run unit tests and
# generate detailed reports on any errors or failures encountered.

import unittest

# Feature: Generate Python code for database interaction.
# Scenario: Given a database schema, the system should generate Python code to interact with the database.

# We can use the sqlalchemy library to generate Python code for database interaction
# based on a given database schema.

import sqlalchemy
