# Feature: Improve error handling and logging in the system.
# Scenario: When an unexpected error occurs, the system should log the error.
# Use built-in logging module to handle errors and exceptions
logging.basicConfig(filename="error_log.txt", level=logging.ERROR)

# Feature: Real-time collaboration.
# Scenario: Multiple users should be able to work on the same codebase simultaneously and see each other's changes.
# Use a distributed version control system like Git for real-time collaboration
# and use Git's merge and conflict resolution functionality to handle simultaneous changes
# on the same codebase
# Use third-party tools like GitHub or Bitbucket to host the codebase and facilitate collaboration
# Use the built-in subprocess module to run Git commands from within the Python codebase
import subprocess

subprocess.run(["git", "merge", "origin/master"])

# Feature: Code quality analysis.
# Scenario: The system should analyze the Python source code for potential issues such as readability, maintainability and performance.
# Use third-party libraries like pylint or flake8 to analyze code quality
# Use a linter in the code editor to provide real-time feedback on code quality
import pylint

pylint.run()

# Feature: Code profiling and optimization.
# Scenario: The system should be able to analyze the performance of Python code and suggest optimizations.
# Use third-party libraries like cProfile to profile the code and identify bottlenecks
# Use numpy and vectorization to optimize numerical operations
# Use list comprehensions instead of for loops for better performance
# Use generators for memory-efficient processing of large datasets
import cProfile

cProfile.run("my_function()")

# Feature: Testing and debugging tools.
# Scenario: The system should provide tools for testing and debugging Python code, allowing developers to identify and fix issues.
# Use built-in debugging tools like pdb for debugging
# Use third-party testing frameworks like pytest or unittest for automated testing
# Use logging and assertions for debugging and error handling
import pdb

pdb.set_trace()

# Feature: Code validation.
# Scenario: The system should validate the generated Python code to ensure it follows best practices and conforms to the coding style.
# Use third-party libraries like Black or autopep8 for code formatting and style enforcement
import black

black.format_file("my_code.py")

# Feature: Add dependencies.
# Scenario: The Code Generation Engine should add necessary dependencies and import statements to the generated Python code for easy execution.
# Use third-party libraries like pip to handle dependencies and install required packages
# Use the built-in import statement to import necessary modules and packages
import pip

pip.install("numpy")

# Use functional programming without classes to simulate AGI
# Use numpy and advanced data structures like dictionaries to represent and manipulate data
# Use the built-in time module for timing operations
# Use list comprehensions for concise and efficient data processing
# Use the built-in sys module for system-specific functionality
