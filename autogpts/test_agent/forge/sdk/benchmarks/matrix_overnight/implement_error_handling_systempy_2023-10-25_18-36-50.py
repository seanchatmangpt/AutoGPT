# Feature: Implement error handling in the system.
# Scenario: If an error occurs during system operation, the system should catch and handle the error.

import sys

    # code to run the system
    pass
except Exception as e:
    # handle the error
    print("Error occurred: {}".format(e))
    sys.exit(1)

# Feature: Error handling
# Scenario: The system should handle any errors that occur during task parsing and provide appropriate error messages.

# Feature: Collaboration and team management.
# Scenario: The system should allow for multiple developers to work together on the same project.

# code to handle collaboration and team management
# This could involve using tools such as Git, GitHub, or Bitbucket to manage code collaboration and version control.

# Feature: Code readability analysis.
# Scenario: The system should analyze the code for readability and suggest improvements to make the code easier to understand.
