# The above code defines the AGISimulation class that represents an adaptive system for generating and evaluating tasks in Python. It follows Pythonic practices advocated by Luciano Ramalho in "Fluent Python". The code uses a while loop to continuously loop back to task generation, a class to encapsulate the simulation logic, and methods for generating tasks, evaluating code against requirements, and updating the system based on evaluation results.
