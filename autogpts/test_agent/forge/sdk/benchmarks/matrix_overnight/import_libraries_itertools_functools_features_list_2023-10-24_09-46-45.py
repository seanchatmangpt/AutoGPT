# Output:
# Features: User access control, Automated code refactoring, Code completion, Code editor, Automated code analysis, Automated code suggestions, Automated code improvements, Automated error handling, Code structure optimization, Performance optimizations, Code quality reports, Performance reports, Integration with other tools and platforms
# Scenarios:
# Scenario: The system should allow administrators to assign different levels of access to users based on their.
# Scenario: The system should be able to analyze code and automatically refactor it to improve performance and.
# Scenario: The code editor should provide intelligent code completion suggestions based on the context of the code.
# Scenario: The code editor should provide suggestions for fixing any errors or failures in the code.
# Scenario: It should suggest changes to improve the code structure, remove redundant code, and optimize performance.
# Scenario: It should also provide suggestions for improvement and allow the user to approve or reject the changes.
# Scenario: These reports should include metrics such as code complexity, test coverage, and code quality.
# Scenario: These reports should provide insights into the performance of the code, including bottleneck areas and suggested optimizations.
# Scenario: These reports should include information such as code complexity, code coverage, and runtime performance.
