# Feature: Task assignment and tracking.
# Scenario: The system should allow managers to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.

# Feature: Automated code formatting.
# Scenario: The system should automatically format code according to a specified style guide.

# Feature: Code review and collaboration.
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to review and collaborate on Python code, providing

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should be able to generate reports with code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks.

from pylint import epylint as lint

# use epylint to generate reports with code complexity and other metrics
(pylint_stdout, pylint_stderr) = lint.py_run("my_code.py", return_std=True)

# Feature: Code collaboration and review.
# Scenario: The system should be able to identify and fix common code smells and suggest improvements.

from flake8.api import legacy as flake8

# use flake8 to identify and fix common code smells and suggest improvements
style_guide = flake8.get_style_guide()

# Feature: Real-time code collaboration.
# Scenario: The system should allow real-time code collaboration between team members.

# use a collaborative coding platform like CodePen or Google Docs to allow real-time code collaboration between team members
# or use a library like PyLive to enable real-time coding in a local environment.
