# FEATURE: Code formatting
# SCENARIO: The system should format the generated code according to PEP8 standards
# to ensure consistency and readability

import autopep8


# function to format code according to PEP8 standards
def format_code(code):
    return autopep8.fix_code(code)


# EXAMPLE USAGE:
code = "def square(x): return x ** 2"
formatted_code = format_code(code)
print(formatted_code)  # output: def square(x): return x ** 2

# This function can be integrated into the system's code generation process to automatically format
# the generated code before saving or executing it.
# It ensures that all code follows the same formatting style and is easily readable by other developers.

# FEATURE: Create interactive visualizations
# SCENARIO: The system should allow users to create interactive visualizations using various data sources

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd


# function to create interactive visualization
def create_visualization(data, x, y):
    plt.plot(data[x], data[y])
    plt.xlabel(x)
    plt.ylabel(y)
    plt.show()


# EXAMPLE USAGE:
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
create_visualization(data, "x", "y")

# This function can be used to create various types of interactive visualizations such as line plots,
# scatter plots, bar charts, etc. The user can specify the data source and the columns to plot,
# making it highly customizable.

# FEATURE: User authentication and access control
# SCENARIO: The system should allow users to create accounts and log in with a unique username and password


# function to create a new user account
def create_account(username, password):
    # code to save username and password to database
    print("Account created successfully!")


# function to log in with existing account
def login(username, password):
    # code to check if username and password match database records
    print("Login successful!")


# EXAMPLE USAGE:
create_account("johnsmith", "password123")
login("johnsmith", "password123")

# This function can be used to securely manage user accounts and access to the system's features.
# It can be integrated with a database and other security measures to ensure user privacy and protection.

# FEATURE: Integration with version control systems
# SCENARIO: The system should allow users to connect their code repositories (such as Git) and
# update their code with new changes.

import git


# function to connect to a code repository
def connect_repo(repo_url):
    return git.Repo.clone_from(repo_url)


# function to update local code with new changes from the repository
def update_code(repo, branch="master"):
    repo.remotes.origin.fetch()
    repo.git.reset("--hard", "origin/" + branch)
    print("Code updated successfully!")


# EXAMPLE USAGE:
repo = connect_repo("git://github.com/username/repository.git")
update_code(repo, "main")

# This function makes it easy for users to integrate their code with a version control system,
# enabling them to keep track of changes and collaborate with other developers efficiently.

# FEATURE: Automatic code formatting
# SCENARIO: The system should automatically format the Python source code according to industry
# standards and best practices

import autopep8


# function to automatically format code
def auto_format_code(code):
    return autopep8.fix_code(code)


# EXAMPLE USAGE:
code = "def square(x): return x ** 2"
formatted_code = auto_format_code(code)
print(formatted_code)  # output: def square(x): return x ** 2

# This function can be used to automatically format code before committing it to a code repository
# or sharing it with others. It ensures that all code follows the same formatting style and
# adheres to best practices, reducing the chances of errors and improving readability.
