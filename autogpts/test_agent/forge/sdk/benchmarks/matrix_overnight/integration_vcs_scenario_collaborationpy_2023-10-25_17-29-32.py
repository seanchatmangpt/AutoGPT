# Feature: Integration with version control systems.

# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular version control systems such as Git and SVN.
# This will allow for easy collaboration and version tracking.

# Importing the necessary modules from the standard library
import subprocess
import os

# Function to integrate with Git
def git_integration():
  # Check if Git is installed
  if not subprocess.run(["git", "--version"], capture_output=True).returncode:
    # If installed, initialize a new repository
    subprocess.run(["git", "init"])
    # Add all files to the repository
    subprocess.run(["git", "add", "."])
    # Commit the changes
    subprocess.run(["git", "commit", "-m", "'Initial commit'"])
  else:
    # If not installed, prompt the user to install Git
    print("Please install Git to enable version control integration.")

# Function to integrate with SVN
def svn_integration():
  # Check if SVN is installed
  if not subprocess.run(["svn", "--version"], capture_output=True).returncode:
    # If installed, create a new repository
    subprocess.run(["svn", "checkout", "svn://path/to/repo"])
  else:
    # If not installed, prompt the user to install SVN
    print("Please install SVN to enable version control integration.")

# Feature: Code formatting.
# Scenario: The system should format the generated Python code according to the specified coding style or guidelines.

# Importing the necessary modules from the standard library
import black

# Function to format code using Black
def format_code(code):
  # Format the code using Black
  formatted_code = black.format_str(code, mode=black.FileMode())
  # Return the formatted code
  return formatted_code

# Feature: Test results display and suggestion.
# Scenario: The results of the tests and debugging should be displayed to the user.
# It should display the results and suggest fixes for any errors or failures that occur during the testing process.

# Importing the necessary modules from the standard library
import pytest

# Function to run tests and display results
def run_tests():
  # Run tests using pytest and store the result
  test_result = pytest.main()
  # If there are any failures or errors, prompt the user to fix them
  if test_result != 0:
    print("Please fix any errors or failures before continuing.")

# Feature: Integration with testing frameworks.
# Scenario: This will help developers identify and improve areas of code that are causing performance issues.
# It should include information on code complexity, code coverage, and code maintainability.
# Additionally, it should provide recommendations for improving performance.

# Importing the necessary modules from the standard library
import pylint

# Function to generate code analysis report using Pylint
def generate_report(code):
  # Generate a report using Pylint and store the result
  report = pylint.lint.Run([code], do_exit=False)
  # Print the report to the console
  report.print_results()
  # Print recommendations for improving performance
  print("Recommendations for improving performance: ")
  print(report.linter.stats["by_module"]["YourCode"]["Ratings"])

# Feature: Code completion.
# Scenario: The Code Completion feature should automatically fix any syntax errors or bugs in the code.
# It should also prompt the user for any necessary changes before applying the refactoring.

# Importing the necessary modules from the standard library
import jedi

# Function to perform code completion using Jedi
def code_completion(code):
  # Create a Jedi Script object
  script = jedi.Script(code)
  # Get the completion suggestions
  suggestions = script.complete()
  # Print the suggestions to the console
  print("Code completion suggestions: ")
  print(suggestions)

# Example usage:

# Generate a report for a given code snippet
code = "def func(x, y): return x + y"
generate_report(code)

# Format code using Black
code = "x = 5;print(x)"
formatted_code = format_code(code)
print("Formatted code: ")
print(formatted_code)

# Run tests and display results
run_tests()

# Perform code completion for a given code snippet
code = "prnt(x)"
code_completion(code)

# Integrate with Git and SVN
git_integration()
