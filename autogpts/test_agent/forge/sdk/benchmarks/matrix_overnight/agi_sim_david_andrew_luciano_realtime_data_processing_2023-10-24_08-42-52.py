# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho.
# Do not use the keyword pass

# Feature: Provide real-time data processing capabilities.
# Scenario: The system should be able to process and analyze large amounts of data.
# Suggestions: Use generators and comprehensions to process large amounts of data efficiently.


def process_data(data):
    """Process and analyze large amounts of data."""
    results = (x for x in data if x > 0)  # Generator expression
    return sum(results)  # Comprehension


# Feature: Collaboration and version control.
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to work on the same code simultaneously and track changes.
# Suggestions: Use a version control system (e.g. git) and encourage the use of code reviews and pair programming.

# Feature: Real-time collaboration.
# Scenario: Users should be able to collaborate and work on the same project in real-time.
# Suggestions: Use a collaborative coding platform (e.g. Google Docs) or chat tool (e.g. Slack) to enable real-time collaboration.

# Feature: Implementation of a chatbot for task management.
# Scenario: The chatbot should be able to interpret natural language task descriptions.
# Suggestions: Use natural language processing libraries (e.g. NLTK) to interpret task descriptions and automate task management.

# Feature: Integration with testing frameworks.
# Scenario: The system should provide information on code complexity, code coverage, and other relevant performance metrics.
# Suggestions: Use a testing framework (e.g. pytest) to automate testing and provide detailed reports on code complexity and coverage.

# Feature: Code refactoring.
# Scenario: The system should provide suggestions for improving code readability and maintainability.
# Suggestions: Use code review tools (e.g. Code Climate) and refactoring techniques (e.g. SOLID principles) to improve code quality.

# Feature: Code compilation.
# Scenario: The system should be able to compile the generated Python code into an executable file.
# Suggestions: Use a compiler (e.g. Cython) to improve performance and create executable files.

# Feature: Debugging.
# Scenario: The system should provide tools for debugging and troubleshooting.
# Suggestions: Use debugging tools (e.g. pdb) and logging libraries (e.g. logging) to aid in troubleshooting and error handling.

# Feature: Integrated testing framework.
# Scenario: The system should include a testing framework for automated testing of Python code.
# Suggestions: Use a testing framework (e.g. pytest) to automate testing and catch errors and bugs in the code.

# Feature: Live code.
# Scenario: The system should allow for live coding and instant feedback.
# Suggestions: Use live coding platforms (e.g. Jupyter Notebook) or interactive shells (e.g. IPython) to enable live coding and immediate execution of code.
