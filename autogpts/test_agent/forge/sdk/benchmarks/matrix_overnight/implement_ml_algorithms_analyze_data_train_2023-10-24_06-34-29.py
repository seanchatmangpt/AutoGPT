# Feature: Implement machine learning algorithms
# Scenario: The system should be able to analyze and process large amounts of data using machine learning

# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import preprocessing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Preprocess data
X = data.drop(columns=["target"])  # Features
y = data["target"]  # Target variable

# Normalize data
scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)

# Train model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Model accuracy: {}".format(score))


# Feature: Automatic code refactoring
# Scenario: The system should be able to analyze code and automatically make changes to improve performance

# Import necessary library
import autopep8

# Read code from file
with open("code.py", "r") as f:
    code = f.read()

# Refactor code
refactored_code = autopep8.fix_code(code)

# Overwrite original code with refactored code
with open("code.py", "w") as f:
    f.write(refactored_code)


# Feature: Project progress tracking
# Scenario: The system should allow users to track the progress of their projects and tasks

# Define project task dictionary
project_tasks = {
    "Task 1": 0.4,
    "Task 2": 0.8,
    "Task 3": 0.2,
    "Task 4": 0.6,
    "Task 5": 1.0,
}

# Calculate total progress
total_progress = sum(project_tasks.values())

# Print progress report
print("Project Progress: {}%".format(total_progress * 100))


# Feature: Code debugging
# Scenario: The system should provide tools for identifying and fixing errors in the Python code, including breakpoints

# Import necessary library
import pdb

# Set breakpoint
pdb.set_trace()

# Execute code line by line to identify error


# Feature: Version control
# Scenario: The system should allow users to track changes made to the code, revert to previous versions

# Import necessary library
import git

# Initialize repository
repo = git.Repo("path/to/repository")

# Stage and commit changes
repo.git.add(all=True)
repo.index.commit("Commit message")

# Revert to previous commit
repo.git.checkout("commit_id")


# Feature: Integration with testing frameworks
# Scenario: The system should generate reports on code complexity, performance bottlenecks, and potential memory leaks

# Import necessary library
import pytest

# Run tests and generate report
pytest.main(["--complexity", "--bottleneck", "--leaks"])


# Feature: Continuous integration and deployment
# Scenario: The system should automatically run tests, build and deploy the code to a staging environment

# Import necessary libraries
import subprocess
import paramiko

# Run tests
pytest.main()

# Build code
subprocess.call(["python", "setup.py", "build"])

# Deploy to staging environment
ssh_client = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh_client.connect("staging_server", username="username", password="password")
stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh_client.exec_command("python deploy.py")
print(stdout.read())

# Feature: Version control integration
# Scenario: The system should integrate with a version control system

# Import necessary library
import git

# Initialize repository
repo = git.Repo("path/to/repository")

# Push changes to remote repository
repo.git.push("remote_name", "branch_name")
