# System Features
# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The system should have the ability to automatically run tests on the generated code to ensure its functionality.

# import necessary libraries
import unittest
import doctest
import pytest

# run tests automatically
doctest.testmod()
unittest.main()
pytest.main()

# Feature: Machine learning recommendation engine.
# Scenario: Given user preferences and past activities, the system should recommend relevant tasks or projects for the user.

# import necessary libraries
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# load dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()

# split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.2
)

# train model
model = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)

# make predictions on test data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Feature: Integration with project management tools.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular project management tools such as JIRA.

# import necessary libraries
from jira import JIRA

# create connection to JIRA
jira = JIRA("https://jira.example.com")

# Feature: Real-time code collaboration.
# Scenario: Multiple users should be able to simultaneously work on the same code file and see each other's changes in real-time.

# import necessary libraries
from socket import *
import threading

# create socket connection
s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind(("localhost", 5555))
s.listen(1)


# handle multiple connections
def handle_connection(conn):
    # receive and send data
    data = conn.recv(1024)
    conn.send(data)


# start thread for each connection
while True:
    conn, addr = s.accept()
    t = threading.Thread(target=handle_connection, args=(conn,))
    t.start()

# Feature: Detailed reports and suggestions for fixing errors and failures encountered during the testing process.
# Scenario: The system should report any errors or failures and provide suggestions for fixing them.

# import necessary libraries
import logging

# set up logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(
    filename="errors.log", level=logging.ERROR, format="%(levelname)s - %(message)s"
)

# catch and log errors
try:
    # code that could potentially cause an error
    pass
except Exception as e:
    # log error
    logging.error(e)

# Feature: Integration with automated testing frameworks.
# Scenario: The system should provide metrics and reports on code performance, including areas for optimization and potential bottlenecks.

# import necessary libraries
from coverage import coverage
import pytest

# run coverage report
cov = coverage(branch=True)
cov.start()
pytest.main()
cov.stop()
cov.save()
cov.html_report()
