# Output explanation:
# This code implements a closed-loop system for Python coding tasks, following Luciano Ramalho's practices.
# The main_loop function continuously generates tasks using AGI simulations, prompts the user for their code,
# evaluates the code against the task requirements, and handles the result. The generate_task function generates
# a task using AGI simulations. The get_user_code function prompts the user to enter their code. The evaluate function
# evaluates the user code against the task requirements. The handle_result function prints a message based on the
# evaluation result.
