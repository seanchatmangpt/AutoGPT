# Feature: Generate automated reports on system performance.
# Scenario: The system should collect and analyze data on system performance and generate comprehensive
# metrics and reports, such as execution time, memory usage, and bottleneck functions.
import time
import psutil

# Collect system performance data
execution_time = time.process_time()
memory_usage = psutil.virtual_memory().percent

# Analyze data and generate reports
bottleneck_functions = []
# ... Code to identify bottleneck functions
# Print reports
print("Execution time: {:.2f} seconds".format(execution_time))
print("Memory usage: {:.2f}%".format(memory_usage))
print("Bottleneck functions: {}".format(bottleneck_functions))

# Feature: Code completion suggestions.
# Scenario: While writing code, the system should offer autocomplete suggestions based on the language syntax
# and previously written code.
import jedi

# Get code completion suggestions
code = "pri"
# ... Code to retrieve suggestions
suggestions = jedi.api.names(source=code)

# Print suggestions
print("Code completion suggestions: {}".format(suggestions))

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should allow users to easily link their Python source code with a
# version control system, such as Git.
import git

# Link source code with version control system
repo = git.Repo.init()
repo.create_remote("origin", "https://github.com/username/repository.git")

# Feature: Integration with project management tools.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular project management tools like Trello and Asana.
import trello
import asana

# Integrate with Trello
trello_board = trello.Board("board_id")
# ... Code to add cards, lists, etc.

# Integrate with Asana
asana_project = asana.Project("project_id")
# ... Code to add tasks, assignees, etc.

# Feature: Automatic code formatting.
# Scenario: The system should automatically format code according to user-defined style guidelines,
# reducing the need for manual formatting.
import black

# Automatically format code
code = "def function(): x=1"
formatted_code = black.format_file_contents(code, fast=False)

# Print formatted code
print("Formatted code: {}".format(formatted_code))

# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The system should have the ability to automatically run unit tests and integration tests
# on code changes.
import unittest


# Define unit test
class TestFunctions(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 2)


# Run unit test
unittest.main()
