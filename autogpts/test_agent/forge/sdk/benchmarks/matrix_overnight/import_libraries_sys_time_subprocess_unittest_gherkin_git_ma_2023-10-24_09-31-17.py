# Feature: Real-time collaboration.
# Scenario: Multiple users should be able to work on the same task simultaneously, with changes being
# automatically synced across all users.

# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The system should automatically run unit tests on the Python source code to ensure correct functionality and
# performance.

# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The system should run automated tests on the Gherkin features and scenarios to ensure proper functionality
# and performance.

# Feature: Code optimization.
# Scenario: The system should optimize the generated Python code for better performance and efficiency.

# Feature: Debugging.
# The system should provide visualizations and allow for exporting of reports in various formats.

# Feature: Integration with testing frameworks.
# Scenario: The system should allow for integration with popular testing frameworks, such as unittest.

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should allow for integration with popular version control systems, such as Git.

# The system should include reports with details on code performance, such as execution time, memory usage, and potential
# bottlenecks.
# The system should include reports with information on code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks.

# The system should also provide metrics on code complexity, code coverage, and execution time.
