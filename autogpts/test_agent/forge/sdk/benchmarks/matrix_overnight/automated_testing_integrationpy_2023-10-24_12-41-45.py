# Automated testing and continuous integration
# Scenario: The system should run automated tests on the Python source code and integrate changes

# Import necessary modules
import time
import resource
import cProfile


# Define function to perform automated tests
def perform_tests():
    # Code to perform tests
    pass


# Get current execution time
start_time = time.time()

# Call function to perform tests
perform_tests()

# Calculate execution time
execution_time = time.time() - start_time

# Print execution time
print("Execution time: {}".format(execution_time))

# Get current memory usage
memory_usage = resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss

# Print memory usage
print("Memory usage: {}".format(memory_usage))

# Use cProfile to provide code complexity information
cProfile.run("perform_tests()")

# Collaboration and team management
# Scenario: The system should allow for collaboration

# Display test results and any errors or failures
print("Test results: {}".format(perform_tests()))

# Code quality analysis
# Feature: Automated testing
# Scenario: The system should be able to run automated tests on the codebase to ensure functionality

# Call function to perform tests
perform_tests()

# User Authentication
# Scenario: Given a user is on the login page
# When they enter their username and password

# Define variables for username and password
username = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

# Verify username and password
if username == "correct_username" and password == "correct_password":
    print("Login successful!")
else:
    print("Invalid username or password.")
