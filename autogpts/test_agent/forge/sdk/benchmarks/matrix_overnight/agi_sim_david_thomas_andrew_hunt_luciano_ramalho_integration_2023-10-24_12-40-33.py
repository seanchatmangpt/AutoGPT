# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho

# Feature: Integration with version control systems
# Scenario: The system should integrate with version control systems, such as Git
# to allow for efficient project management and collaboration among developers.

# Feature: Integration with popular code editors
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular code editors, such as Visual Studio Code
# to provide an enhanced coding experience for developers.

# Feature: Automatic code completion
# Scenario: The system should suggest possible code completions as the user types,
# based on the context of the code and the user's coding patterns.

# Feature: Automatic code refactoring suggestions
# Scenario: The system should analyze the Python code and provide suggestions for
# refactoring to improve code structure and performance.

# Feature: Task management dashboard
# Scenario: The system should have a user-friendly dashboard that displays all active
# tasks, their status, and relevant information such as deadline, importance, and urgency.

# Feature: Task prioritization
# Scenario: The system should be able to prioritize tasks based on their deadline,
# importance, and urgency to help developers focus on critical tasks.

# Feature: Improve error handling
# Scenario: When an unexpected error occurs, the system should provide a clear and
# informative error message to help developers diagnose and fix the issue.

# Feature: Code version control
# Scenario: The system should allow users to track changes made to code and revert
# to previous versions if needed, providing a safety net for code changes.

# Feature: Integration with testing frameworks
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular testing frameworks, such as
# pytest and unittest, to provide automated testing and ensure code quality.

# Feature: Code review and collaboration
# Scenario: The system should provide a platform for code review and collaboration
# among developers, allowing for efficient communication and feedback on code changes.

# These metrics and reports should include code complexity, code coverage, execution time,
# and other relevant information to help developers improve code quality.

# These reports should include information on code complexity, code coverage, and performance
# benchmarks to help developers identify areas for improvement.

# Feature: Integration with performance monitoring tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with performance monitoring tools, such as
# New Relic or Datadog, to provide real-time performance metrics and help developers
# optimize code for better performance.

# Feature: Integration with code analysis tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with code analysis tools, such as Pylint or
# flake8, to provide automated code reviews and ensure adherence to coding standards
# and best practices.

# Feature: Integration with project management tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with project management tools, such as Jira
# or Trello, to provide a seamless workflow and efficient project management for developers.
