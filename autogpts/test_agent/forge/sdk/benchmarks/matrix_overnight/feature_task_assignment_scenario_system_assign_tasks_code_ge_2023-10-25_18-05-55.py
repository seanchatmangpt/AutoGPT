# Feature: Task assignment
# Scenario: The system should assign tasks to team members based on their availability and skill set.

# Given a set of actionable items for a Python project, the Code Generation Engine should generate initial Python code with proper syntax and

# Feature: User authentication
# Scenario: Given a user's credentials, the system should verify their identity and grant access to authorized users.

# Feature: Integration with third-party tools

# The engine should provide detailed reports of any errors or failures in the code and suggest potential fixes.
# The metrics and reports should include code complexity, code coverage, and other relevant performance indicators.
