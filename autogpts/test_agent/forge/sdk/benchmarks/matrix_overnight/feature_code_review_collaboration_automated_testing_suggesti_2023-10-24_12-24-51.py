# Feature: Code review and collaboration
# Scenario: Developers should be able to collaborate on code changes and receive suggestions for improving readability and maintainability
# Feature: Automated testing
# Scenario: The system should run automated tests and provide suggestions for common code smells and bugs
# Feature: Integration with project management tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular project management tools like Asana
# Feature: Collaborative coding
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to code together in real-time, with the ability to track changes and communicate
# Feature: Code coverage analysis
# Feature: Continuous integration
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular CI tools like Jenkins to automatically run tests and provide detailed reports
# Feature: Integration with version control
# Scenario: The system should integrate with version control tools like Git and provide detailed reports on code complexity and performance
