# feature: debugging support
# scenario: the IDE should have a debugger that allows users to set breakpoints, step through code, and view reports

from debugger import Debugger

# create a debugger instance

# iterate through code and step through
debugger.step_code()

# view reports

# feature: integration with development tools
# scenario: the system should include reports for code complexity, coverage, and performance benchmarks

from reports import generate_reports

# generate reports for code complexity, coverage, and performance benchmarks

# view reports
print(reports)

# feature: integration with debugging tools
# scenario: the system should include metrics and reports for code complexity, execution time, memory usage, and potential bottlenecks

# feature: task assignment and delegation
# scenario: the system should allow users to assign tasks to other team members and track their progress

# feature: multi-factor authentication
# scenario: the system should allow users to enable multi-factor authentication for added security

from authentication import Authentication

# create an authentication instance

# enable multi-factor authentication

# feature: user account management
# scenario: the system should allow users to create and manage their own accounts, including changing passwords

from user import User

# create a user

# create an account
user.create_account(username="luciano", password="fluentpython")

# manage account by changing password
