This code snippet contains the main functions and logic to implement the "Adaptive System Update" feature. It includes functions to update the system based on evaluation results, generate tasks for the system, and execute a given task. You can use these functions as building blocks to implement the complete system following Pythonic practices and Fluent Python principles taught by Luciano Ramalho in his book "Fluent Python". Make sure to fill in the TODO sections with the necessary logic specific to your system's requirements.
