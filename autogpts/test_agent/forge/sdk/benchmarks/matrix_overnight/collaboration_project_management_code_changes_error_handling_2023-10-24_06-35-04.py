# Feature: Collaboration and project management.
# Scenario: The system should suggest code changes to improve code readability and maintainability.

# Feature: Automatic error handling and reporting.
# Scenario: If an unexpected error occurs during execution, the system should catch it and handle it.

# Feature: Automated bug detection and resolution.
# Scenario: The system should be able to detect and resolve common bugs in the code.

# Feature: Integration with project management tools.
