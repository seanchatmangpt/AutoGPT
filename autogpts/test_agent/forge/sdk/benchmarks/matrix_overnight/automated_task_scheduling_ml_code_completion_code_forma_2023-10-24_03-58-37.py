# Automated task scheduling
# The system should be able to automatically schedule tasks based on their priority and dependencies.

# Machine learning algorithm for code completion
# The system should use machine learning algorithms to suggest code completion options based on the input.

# Code formatting and style checking
# These reports should provide insights into the code's performance, such as execution time, memory usage, and overall efficiency.
