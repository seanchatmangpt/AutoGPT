This Python code follows Luciano Ramalho's teachings in "Fluent Python" by using Pythonic practices such as concise and idiomatic code. It defines functions for each step of the process: generating task requirements, executing code, evaluating code against task requirements, and updating the system state. The `update_system()` function uses a `while` loop to continuously loop back to task generation after each cycle. The code is well-documented with docstrings that provide Design by Contract (DbC) information.
