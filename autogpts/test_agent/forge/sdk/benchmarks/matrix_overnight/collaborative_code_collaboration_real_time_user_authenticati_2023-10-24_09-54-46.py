# Collaborative code collaboration
# The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on the same Python project

# Real-time collaboration
# Multiple users should be able to work on the same codebase simultaneously and see each other's changes in real-time

# User authentication
# Users should be able to create an account, log in, and access their personalized information

# Integration with version control systems
# The system should be able to integrate with popular version control systems such as Git and SVN

# Integration with external tools
# The system should be able to integrate with external tools for code analysis and optimization

# Debugging tools
# The system should include debugging tools such as breakpoints, step-through execution, and variable inspection

# Collaborative code review and feedback
# The system should allow for collaborative code review and feedback among team members

# Automated code generation
# Given a user has a database schema, when they input the database schema into the system, then the system should generate Python code

# Automated code fixing and optimization
# The system should automatically fix any identified security vulnerabilities, make necessary changes to the code without changing its functionality, and optimize code for performance

# Automated code analysis and reporting
# The system should provide detailed reports on code complexity, test coverage, performance metrics, execution time, memory usage, and code duplication. These reports should be customizable based on user preferences.
