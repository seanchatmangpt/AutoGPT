# Feature: Support multi-threading in Python code
# Scenario: Identify sections of existing Python code that can be multi-threaded
# and execute them in parallel

# Import the threading module
import threading


# Define a function to be executed in a separate thread
def multi_threaded_function(arg1, arg2):
    # Code to be executed in parallel
    pass


# Create a new thread for the function
thread = threading.Thread(target=multi_threaded_function, args=(arg1, arg2))

# Start the thread
thread.start()

# Wait for the thread to finish executing
thread.join()

# Feature: Debugging tools
# Scenario: The system should provide debugging tools to help identify and fix any errors or issues in the code

# Import the pdb (Python Debugger) module
import pdb

# Set a breakpoint in the code
pdb.set_trace()

# Feature: Collaboration and version control
# Scenario: Multiple users should be able to collaborate on the same code and track changes made by each user

# Use a version control system, such as Git, to manage code changes and allow for collaboration between multiple users

# Feature: Integration with project management tools
# Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with popular project management tools such as Trello

# Use a package, such as py-trello, to integrate with Trello and allow for project management within the system

# Feature: Automated scheduling of tasks
# Scenario: The system should automatically schedule tasks based on their priority and due date, taking into account system resources and dependencies

# Use a task scheduling library, such as schedule, to automatically schedule tasks based on their priority and due date, while also considering system resources and dependencies

# Feature: Continuous integration and deployment
# Scenario: The system should regularly check for changes in the codebase, run tests, and deploy updates to the production environment

# Use a continuous integration and deployment platform, such as Jenkins, to regularly check for changes in the codebase, run tests, and deploy updates to the production environment

# Feature: Error handling
# Scenario: The system should be able to handle errors and provide helpful error messages to the user

# Use try/except statements to handle potential errors and provide informative error messages to the user

# Feature: Collaboration and team workflow
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase and manage their contributions

# Use a code collaboration platform, such as GitHub, to manage multiple developers working on the same codebase and track their contributions

# Feature: Code version control
# Scenario: The system should track changes made to the code and allow for version control

# Use a version control system, such as Git, to track changes made to the code and allow for version control

# Feature: Code refactoring suggestions
# Scenario: The system should suggest potential code refactoring options to improve code quality and performance

# Use a code analysis tool, such as pylint, to identify potential code refactoring options and provide suggestions for improving code quality and performance
