# Feature: Error reporting
# Scenario: The system should display any errors or failures encountered during the testing process.


# Define a function that takes in a list of errors and prints them out
def report_errors(errors):
    for error in errors:
        print(error)


# Feature: Code version control
# Scenario: The system should provide detailed reports on any errors or failures encountered during the testing process.
# and include information on code complexity, code coverage, and performance metrics such as execution time and memory usage.


# Define a function that takes in a list of errors and performance metrics and prints them out
def report_errors_and_metrics(
    errors, complexity, coverage, execution_time, memory_usage
):
    print("Errors:")
    for error in errors:
        print(error)
    print("Code complexity: {}".format(complexity))
    print("Code coverage: {}".format(coverage))
    print("Execution time: {}".format(execution_time))
    print("Memory usage: {}".format(memory_usage))


# Feature: User authentication
# Scenario: The system should allow users to create an account and log in with their credentials.


# Define a function that takes in a username and password and creates a new user account
def create_user_account(username, password):
    # Code to create user account
    return "User account created successfully."


# Define a function that takes in a username and password and verifies if the user can log in
def log_in(username, password):
    # Code to verify login credentials
    if username == "valid_username" and password == "valid_password":
        return "Log in successful."
    else:
        return "Invalid username or password."


# Feature: Debugging tools for Python
# Scenario: The system should provide debugging tools such as breakpoints, step-by-step execution

# Import the built-in 'pdb' module for debugging
import pdb


# Define a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers
def sum_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total


# Set a breakpoint at the beginning of the function
pdb.set_trace()

# Call the function with a list of numbers
sum_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Feature: Team collaboration and task assignment
# Scenario: The system should allow users to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.


# Define a function that takes in a task and assigns it to a team member
def assign_task(task, team_member):
    # Code to assign task to team member
    return "Task '{}' assigned to {}.".format(task, team_member)


# Define a function that takes in a task and updates its progress
def update_task_progress(task, progress):
    # Code to update task progress
    return "Task '{}' progress updated to {}.".format(task, progress)


# Feature: Automated code review
# Scenario: The system should automatically review the Python source code for common coding errors and suggest improvements.

# Import the built-in 'pylint' module for code analysis
import pylint


# Define a function that takes in a Python source code file and returns a list of suggested improvements
def analyze_code(file):
    # Code to analyze code using 'pylint'
    return [
        "Line 10: Unused variable 'x'",
        "Line 15: Missing docstring for function 'sum_numbers'",
    ]


# Example:Input: "Create a new user account for John Doe"
# Output: Task Parsing Engine creates a new user account for John Doe


# Define a function that takes in a task and a user and returns a confirmation message
def create_user_task(task, user):
    # Code to process task and user data
    return "Task Parsing Engine creates {} for {}.".format(task, user)
