# Feature: User authentication.
# Scenario: Given a login form, the system should verify the user's credentials and grant access to

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should be able to connect to Git or other version control systems and

# Feature: Automatic code formatting.
# Scenario: The system should automatically format code according to a specified style guide to improve readability and

# Feature: Integration with external code analysis.
# Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with external code analysis tools to provide reports on code complexity, code coverage, and performance.

# Feature: Database schema mapping.
# Scenario: The Code Generation Engine should generate Python code that maps the database schema to corresponding Python objects.

# Feature: Code analysis and refactoring suggestions.
# Scenario: The system should analyze the code and provide recommendations for refactoring to improve performance, readability, and maintainability.
