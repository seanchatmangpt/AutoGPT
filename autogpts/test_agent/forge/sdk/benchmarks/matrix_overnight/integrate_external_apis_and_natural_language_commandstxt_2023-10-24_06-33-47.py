# Feature: Integrate with external APIs.
# Scenario: The system should allow users to connect with external APIs and retrieve data

# The system should be able to understand and interpret natural language commands
# and convert them into specific tasks or actions for the user to perform

# Feature: Automatic code formatting.
# Scenario: The system should have the ability to automatically format code according to specified coding conventions.

# Given a database schema, the Code Generation Engine should analyze the schema
# and generate Python code to interact with the database.

# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The generated code should be tested automatically to ensure its functionality and compatibility with external APIs.

# Feature: Real-time code analysis.
# Scenario: The system should provide real-time analysis of the code, highlighting potential issues and suggesting improvements.

# The results should be displayed to the user.

# Feature: Code version control.
# Scenario: The system should allow users to track changes.

# Feature: Performance metrics and reports.
# Scenario: The system should generate reports on code complexity, test coverage, and performance benchmarks.

# These performance metrics should include but not limited to execution time, memory usage, and code coverage.

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.

# Feature: Integration with external tools and systems.
# Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with popular external tools and systems such as version control systems.
