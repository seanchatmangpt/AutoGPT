Notes:
- The code uses Pythonic practices such as using meaningful variable names and following PEP 8 style guide.
- The code defines a `TaskManager` class to manage the tasks.
- The `TaskManager` class has methods to add tasks, execute tasks, and run the task manager in a continuous loop.
- The code uses a while loop to ensure continuous loop back to task generation after each cycle.
- The code includes a placeholder for executing the task based on its requirements. 

Please note that I've replaced some parts of the code with `...` as the implementation details were not provided.
