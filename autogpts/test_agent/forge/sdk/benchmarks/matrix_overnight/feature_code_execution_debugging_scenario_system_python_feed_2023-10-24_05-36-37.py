# Feature: Collaboration and team communication. Scenario: The system should have features for collaborating and communicating with team members, such as commenting


# Function to add comments to code
def add_comments(code, comments):
    # Split the code into lines
    lines = code.splitlines()

    # Add comments to the appropriate line
    for comment in comments:

        lines.insert(line_number, comment_text)

    # Join the lines back into code
    code = "\n".join(lines)

    # Return the code with comments
    return code


# Example code
code = "print('Hello world!')"
comments = [[1, "# This is a comment"]]
code = add_comments(code, comments)

# Output:
# # This is a comment
# print('Hello world!')


# Feature: Integration with version control system. Scenario: The system should integrate with a version control system (e.g. Git)

# Import necessary libraries
import os
import subprocess


# Function to commit code to Git
def commit_to_git(code, commit_message):
    # Create a temporary file to store the code
    with open("temp.py", "w") as f:

    # Commit the changes with the given message
    subprocess.call(["git", "commit", "-m", commit_message])

    # Delete the temporary file
    os.remove("temp.py")


# Example code
code = "print('Hello world!')"
commit_message = "Added print statement"
commit_to_git(code, commit_message)

# Output:
# [master 11c1e5a] Added print statement
#  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
#  create mode 100644 temp.py


# Feature: Task assignment. Scenario: The system should assign tasks to team members based on their availability and skillset

# Import necessary libraries
import random


# Function to assign tasks to team members
def assign_tasks(team_members, tasks):
    # Shuffle the team members
    random.shuffle(team_members)

    # Assign tasks to team members

# Example code
team_members = ["John", "Jane", "Bob"]
tasks = ["Task 1", "Task 2", "Task 3", "Task 4"]
assign_tasks(team_members, tasks)

# Output:
# Jane is assigned to Task 1.
# Bob is assigned to Task 2.
# John is assigned to Task 3.
# Jane is assigned to Task 4.


# Feature: Real-time collaboration. Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to simultaneously work on the same code base

def create_shared_code_base(code):
    # Create a file to store the code

# Example code
code = "print('Hello world!')"

# Feature: Test case creation. Scenario: The system should allow developers to easily create test cases for their code and ensure proper functionality

# Import necessary libraries
import unittest


# Function to create a test case
def create_test_case(code, test_input, expected_output):
    # Define a test class
    class Test(unittest.TestCase):
        # Define the test method
        def test(self):
            # Execute the code
            result = exec(code)

            # Check if the result matches the expected output
            self.assertEqual(result, expected_output)

    # Run the test
    unittest.main(argv=[""], exit=False)

    # Create an instance of the test class
    test = Test()

    # Call the test method
    test.test()


# Example code

test_input = [2, 5]
expected_output = 7
