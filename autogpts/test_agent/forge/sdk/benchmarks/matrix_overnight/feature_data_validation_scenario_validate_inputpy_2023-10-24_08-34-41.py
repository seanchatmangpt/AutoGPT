# Feature: Data validation.
# Scenario: The system should validate user input against the database schema to ensure data integrity.


# use the built-in function isinstance to validate input data against the expected data type
def validate_input(input_data, expected_type):
    if not isinstance(input_data, expected_type):
        raise TypeError(f"Input data must be of type {expected_type}")


# Feature: Integration with reporting tools.
# Scenario: These reports should include information such as execution time, memory usage, and line-by-line performance analysis.

# use the standard library module timeit for execution time, and the memory_profiler module for memory usage
import timeit
import memory_profiler


# create a function that takes in a code snippet, executes it, and returns the execution time and memory usage
def run_code(code_snippet):
    start_time = timeit.default_timer()
    mem_usage = memory_profiler.memory_usage()
    exec(code_snippet)
    end_time = timeit.default_timer()
    return end_time - start_time, max(mem_usage)


# Feature: Integration with performance analysis tools.
# Scenario: These metrics and reports should include information such as code complexity, code coverage, and memory usage, to help identify areas for improvement

# use the built-in function dir to get a list of all attributes and methods of an object, and the standard library module coverage for code coverage analysis
import inspect
import coverage


# create a function that takes in a code snippet and returns a list of all its attributes and methods
def get_code_attributes(code_snippet):
    return dir(code_snippet)


# create a function that takes in a code snippet and returns its code coverage analysis report
def get_code_coverage(code_snippet):
    cov = coverage.Coverage()
    cov.start()
    exec(code_snippet)
    cov.stop()
    cov.save()
    cov.report()
    return cov.html_report()


# Feature: Integration with external tools.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular project management and collaboration tools, such as Trello

# use the requests library to integrate with Trello's API
import requests


# create a function that takes in a Trello API endpoint and performs a GET request to retrieve data
def get_trello_data(endpoint):
    base_url = "https://api.trello.com/1/"
    response = requests.get(base_url + endpoint)
    return response.json()


# Feature: Code profiling.
# Scenario: The system should provide detailed reports and analysis of the test results.

# use the built-in function cProfile for code profiling and the standard library module pstats for detailed reports and analysis
import cProfile
import pstats


# create a function that takes in a code snippet and runs it with the cProfile profiler, returning the resulting statistics
def profile_code(code_snippet):
    pr = cProfile.Profile()
    pr.enable()
    exec(code_snippet)
    pr.disable()
    stats = pstats.Stats(pr)
    stats.sort_stats("cumulative").print_stats()
    return stats
