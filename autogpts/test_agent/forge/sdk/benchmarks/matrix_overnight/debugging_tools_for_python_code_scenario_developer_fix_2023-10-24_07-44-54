  - This should include information such as lines of code, code complexity, and test
    coverage.
  - This will help developers in identifying potential bottlenecks and optimizing
    the code for better performance.
  - ''
  - These metrics may include code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks.
    The reports should be easily accessible and customizable.
