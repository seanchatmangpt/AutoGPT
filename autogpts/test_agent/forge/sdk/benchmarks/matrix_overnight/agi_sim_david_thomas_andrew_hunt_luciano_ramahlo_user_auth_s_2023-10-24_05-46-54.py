# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt,Luciano Ramahlo.

# Feature: User authentication

# Scenario: User signs up for an account

# Given a user is on the sign up page:
user = User()
user.sign_up()

# The results of the tests should be displayed to the user:
test_results = run_tests()
display_results(test_results)

# It should also provide detailed reports on any errors or failures encountered during testing:
error_reports = generate_error_reports(test_results)
display_error_reports(error_reports)

# Feature: Collaborative coding and review
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on code in real-time

# Given a code collaboration session is initiated:
collab_session = initiate_collaboration()

# And multiple users join the session:
users = [User1, User2, User3]
collab_session.add_users(users)

# It should analyze the code and suggest changes to improve performance and readability:
code = collab_session.get_code()
suggested_changes = analyze_code(code)
collab_session.make_changes(suggested_changes)

# Feature: Integration with testing frameworks.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular testing frameworks such as pytest

# Given a project is set up with pytest:
project = Project()
project.set_up_test_framework("pytest")

# When tests are run:
test_results = project.run_tests()

# Then the system should provide reports on execution time, memory usage, and any potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization:
performance_reports = generate_performance_reports(test_results)
display_performance_reports(performance_reports)

# Feature: Automatic code refactoring.
# Scenario: The system should analyze code and automatically suggest and implement refactoring techniques

# Given a codebase is loaded into the system:
codebase = load_codebase()

# When the system analyzes the code:
suggested_refactoring = analyze_code(codebase)

# Then it should automatically implement the suggested changes:
codebase.refactor(suggested_refactoring)

# Feature: Integration with version control system.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with a version control system, such as Git

# Given a project is set up with Git:
project = Project()
project.set_up_version_control("Git")

# When changes are made to the codebase:
codebase = project.get_codebase()
codebase.make_changes()

# Then the system should commit and push the changes to the remote repository:
project.commit_and_push()

# Feature: Integration with project management tools.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular project management tools such as Trello

# Given a project is set up with Trello:
project = Project()
project.set_up_project_management_tool("Trello")

# When a new task is created:
task = Task("Add new feature")

# Then the system should create a new card on the Trello board:
project.add_task_to_board(task)
