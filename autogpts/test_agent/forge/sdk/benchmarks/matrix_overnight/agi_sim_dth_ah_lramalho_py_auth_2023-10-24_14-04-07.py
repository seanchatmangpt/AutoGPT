# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho
# Idiomatic and concise Python code based on the teachings of Luciano Ramalho in "Fluent Python"

# Feature: User authentication
# Scenario: Given a user's login credentials, the system should verify the user's identity and grant access


# function that takes in user credentials and checks against a database of authorized users
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    authorized_users = {
        "username1": "password1",
        "username2": "password2",
        "username3": "password3",
    }

    # use dictionary method get() to check if username exists in the authorized_users dictionary
    if authorized_users.get(username):
        # use dictionary method get() again to check if password matches for the specified username
        if authorized_users.get(username) == password:
            # return True to indicate successful authentication
            return True

    # if username or password does not match, return False to indicate failed authentication
    return False


# Feature: Automated testing
# Scenario: The system should run automated tests on the project code to ensure functionality and catch any errors


# function that runs automated tests on project code
def run_tests():
    # import pytest library for running tests
    import pytest

    # run all tests using pytest's main function
    pytest.main()


# Feature: Integration with third-party testing tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with third-party testing tools to provide performance metrics and reports


# function that integrates with third-party testing tools and returns performance metrics and reports
def integrate_with_testing_tools():
    # import third-party testing tool
    import third_party_testing_tool

    # use third-party testing tool's functions to generate performance metrics and reports
    performance_metrics = third_party_testing_tool.calculate_metrics()
    performance_reports = third_party_testing_tool.generate_reports()

    # return performance metrics and reports
    return performance_metrics, performance_reports


# Feature: Collaboration and project management
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on a project, assign tasks, and track progress


# function that allows multiple users to collaborate on a project
def collaborate_on_project():
    # import collaboration library
    import collaboration_library

    # use collaboration library's functions to allow multiple users to collaborate, assign tasks, and track progress
    collaboration_library.allow_collaboration()
    collaboration_library.assign_tasks()
    collaboration_library.track_progress()


# Feature: Version control integration
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular version control systems, such as Git, to track changes and manage code versions


# function that integrates with version control systems
def integrate_with_version_control():
    # import version control library
    import version_control_library

    # use version control library's functions to integrate with popular version control systems
    version_control_library.integrate_with_git()
    version_control_library.integrate_with_svn()


# Feature: Real-time collaboration
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on the same code in real-time


# function that enables real-time collaboration
def enable_real_time_collaboration():
    # import real-time collaboration library
    import real_time_collaboration_library

    # use real-time collaboration library's functions to enable real-time collaboration
    real_time_collaboration_library.enable_real_time_collaboration()


# Feature: Automatic code optimization
# Scenario: The system should automatically optimize code for performance and offer suggestions for improving the code structure


# function that automatically optimizes code and offers suggestions
def optimize_code():
    # import automatic code optimization library
    import automatic_code_optimization_library

    # use automatic code optimization library's functions to optimize code and offer suggestions
    automatic_code_optimization_library.optimize_code()
    automatic_code_optimization_library.offer_suggestions()


# Feature: Database schema mapping updates
# Scenario: The system should update any affected code in the database schema mapping


# function that updates database schema mapping
def update_database_schema_mapping():
    # import database schema mapping library
    import database_schema_mapping_library

    # use database schema mapping library's functions to update mapping
    database_schema_mapping_library.update_mapping()
