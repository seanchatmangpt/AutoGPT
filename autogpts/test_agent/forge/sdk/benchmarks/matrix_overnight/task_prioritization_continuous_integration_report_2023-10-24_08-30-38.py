# Task prioritization
# The system should prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance to the overall project.
# Feature:

# Continuous integration
# The system should integrate with a continuous integration tool, such as Jenkins, to automatically build,
# It should also generate a report to show the changes made and the reasoning behind them.
# Feature:

# Code profiling and debugging
# These reports should include information on code complexity, code coverage, and performance.
# Feature:

# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho.
# The results should be displayed in an easily readable format for the user.
# It should provide detailed reports of any errors or failures encountered, along with suggestions for fixes.
# Feature:
