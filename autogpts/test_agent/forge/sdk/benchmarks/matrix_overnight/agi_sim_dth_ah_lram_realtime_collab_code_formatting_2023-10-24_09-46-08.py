# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho

# Feature: Real-time collaboration
# Scenario: Multiple users should be able to collaborate on the same code project in real-time

# Feature: Code formatting
# Scenario: The system should format the generated Python code according to PEP8 standards

# Feature: Support for generating reports on code complexity, test coverage, and performance indicators
# Scenario: The system should generate reports on execution time, memory usage, and potential bottlenecks

# Feature: Integration with test automation
# Scenario: The system should integrate with test automation tools and provide detailed reports on errors or failures

# Feature: Code profiling and optimization
# Scenario: The system should provide a report on code complexity, execution time, memory usage, and other performance metrics

# Feature: Collaboration and communication tools
# Scenario: The system should provide tools for collaboration and communication between users working on the same task

# Feature: Integration with version control systems
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular version control systems like Git and SVN

# Feature: Code formatting and style checking
# Scenario: The system should format code according to PEP8 standards and perform style checks for consistency
