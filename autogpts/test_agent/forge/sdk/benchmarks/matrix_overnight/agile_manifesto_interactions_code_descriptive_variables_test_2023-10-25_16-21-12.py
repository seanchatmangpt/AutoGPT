# Agile Manifesto: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
# Instead of relying on comments, write clear and concise code that is self-documenting
# Use descriptive and meaningful variable names instead of relying on comments to explain their purpose

# Feature: Testing and debugging capabilities
# Scenario: The system should provide tools for testing and debugging Python code, such as a built
# This can be achieved by using the built-in Python debugger, pdb, or using a third-party debugger like PyCharm

# Feature: Code completion
# Scenario: The system should provide code completion suggestions to assist with writing Python code
# Instead of relying on code completion, write modular and reusable code that follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

# Feature: Syntax highlighting
# Syntax highlighting should be implemented using a text editor or IDE that supports it, such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code

# Feature: Automated code optimization
# Scenario: The system should automatically optimize the code to improve performance and efficiency
# Instead of relying on automated optimization, write efficient and optimized code from the beginning using best practices and data structures

# Feature: Code coverage analysis
# Scenario: The system should perform code coverage analysis on the Python project and generate a report showing the
# This can be achieved by using a code coverage tool like Coverage.py or pytest-cov

# Feature: Continuous Integration and Deployment
# Scenario: The system should automatically run tests and deploy changes when code is pushed to the repository
# This can be achieved by setting up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions

# Feature: Code complexity analysis
# Scenario: The system should analyze the code complexity and provide reports with suggestions for improvement
# This can be achieved by using a code complexity tool like Radon or Pylint

# Feature: Performance benchmarking
# Scenario: The system should benchmark the code's performance and provide reports with insights and suggestions for improvement
# This can be achieved by using a performance profiling tool like cProfile or Py-Spy

# Feature: Automated documentation generation
# Scenario: The system should automatically generate documentation for the code, including docstrings and comments
# This can be achieved by using a documentation generation tool like Sphinx or pdoc3
