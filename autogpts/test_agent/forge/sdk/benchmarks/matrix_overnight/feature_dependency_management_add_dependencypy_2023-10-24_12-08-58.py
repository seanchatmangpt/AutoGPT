# Feature: Dependency Management

# Scenario: User wants to add a new dependency to the project

# Given the user has a project
project = Project()

# When the user adds a new dependency
project.add_dependency(dependency)

# Then the dependency should be successfully added
assert dependency in project.dependencies


# Feature: Integration with project management tools.

# Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with popular project management tools such as Trello and Jira
# Given the system has access to Trello and Jira APIs
trello = TrelloAPI()
jira = JiraAPI()

# When the system integrates with Trello and Jira
trello_integration = Integration(trello)
jira_integration = Integration(jira)

# Then the integration should be successful
assert trello_integration.is_success
assert jira_integration.is_success


# Feature: Task assignment

# Scenario: Given a task and a list of team members, the system should assign the task to a member
# Given a task and a list of team members
task = Task()
team_members = [member1, member2, member3]

# When the system assigns the task to a member
assigned_member = assign_task(task, team_members)

# Then the task should be assigned to a member in the list
assert assigned_member in team_members


# Feature: User authentication

# Scenario: User should be able to create an account with a unique username and password
# Given a user
user = User()

# When the user creates an account with a unique username and password
user.create_account(username, password)

# Then the account should be successfully created
assert user.account.is_active


# Feature: Integration with Continuous Integration tools

# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular Continuous Integration tools such as Jenkins and Travis CI
# Given the system has access to Jenkins and Travis CI APIs
jenkins = JenkinsAPI()
travis_ci = TravisCIAPI()

# When the system integrates with Jenkins and Travis CI
jenkins_integration = Integration(jenkins)
travis_ci_integration = Integration(travis_ci)

# Then the integration should be successful
assert jenkins_integration.is_success
assert travis_ci_integration.is_success


# Feature: Code optimization and debugging

# Scenario: The system should identify and suggest ways to optimize the Python code for better performance
# Given a Python code
python_code = "print('Hello, World!')"

# When the system optimizes the code
optimized_code = optimize_code(python_code)

# Then the optimized code should be suggested
assert optimized_code != python_code
