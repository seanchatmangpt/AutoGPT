    print("Progress: {:.2f}%".format(progress))

# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The system should have a built-in testing framework that automatically runs tests on code changes.

# Import the unittest module for automated testing
import unittest

# Define a test case class
class TestCodeChanges(unittest.TestCase):
    # Define a test method
    def test_code_changes(self):
        # Create a dummy function that returns a string
        def dummy_function():
            return "Hello, world!"
        # Use the assertEqual method to check if the returned string is equal to "Hello, world!"
        self.assertEqual(dummy_function(), "Hello, world!")

# Feature: Code formatting.
# Scenario: The system should provide options to format the generated code according to industry standards and user preferences.

# Import the autopep8 module for code formatting
import autopep8

# Define a function to format code according to user preferences
def format_code(code, preferences):
    # Use the autopep8 module to format the code
    formatted_code = autopep8.fix_code(code, options=preferences)
    # Return the formatted code
    return formatted_code

# Feature: Code quality analysis.
# Scenario: The system should perform code quality analysis and provide suggestions for improving code quality.

# Import the radon module for code quality analysis
import radon

# Define a function to analyze code quality and provide suggestions for improvement
def analyze_quality(code):
    # Use the radon module to analyze the code
    results = radon.complexity.cc_visit(code)
    # Loop through the results and print any suggestions for improvement
    for result in results:
        if result.complexity >= 10:
            print("Consider simplifying function '{}' to improve code quality".format(result.name))

# Feature: Integration with debugging tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with debugging tools to provide detailed performance reports.

# Import the cProfile module for performance profiling
import cProfile

# Define a function to profile code performance
def profile_performance(code):
    # Use the cProfile module to profile the code
    cProfile.run(code)

# Feature: Codebase metrics and reports.
# Scenario: The system should provide metrics and reports on the codebase, including code complexity, lines of code, and test coverage.

# Import the coverage module for code coverage reports
import coverage

# Define a function to generate code coverage reports
def generate_coverage_report(code):
    # Create a coverage object
    cov = coverage.Coverage()
    # Start tracking code coverage
    cov.start()
    # Execute the code
    exec(code)
    # Stop tracking code coverage
    cov.stop()
    # Generate the coverage report
    cov.report()

# Import the pycodestyle module for code style reports
import pycodestyle

# Define a function to generate code style reports
def generate_style_report(code):
    # Create a StyleGuide object
    style_guide = pycodestyle.StyleGuide()
    # Check the code for style violations
    result = style_guide.check_files([code])
    # Print the number of violations found
    print("Number of style violations found: {}".format(result.total_errors))

# Import the mccabe module for code complexity reports
import mccabe

# Define a function to generate code complexity reports
def generate_complexity_report(code):
    # Use the mccabe module to analyze the code
    results = mccabe.get_module_complexity(code)
    # Print the complexity of the code
    print("Code complexity: {}".format(results.complexity))

# Feature: Suggestions for code optimization and improvement.
# Scenario: The system should provide suggestions for optimizing algorithms, removing redundant code, and improving code readability and maintainability.

# Use the suggestions provided in previous features to optimize and improve the code.
# For example, use the results from the code quality analysis to simplify complex functions, use the code formatting options to improve readability, and use the codebase metrics to identify and remove redundant code.

# Feature: Integration with debugging tools.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with debugging tools to provide detailed performance reports.

# Use the profiling function to generate performance reports for the code.
# For example, use the cProfile module to identify code sections that are taking a long time to execute and optimize them for improved performance.
