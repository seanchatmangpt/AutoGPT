# Feature: Implement machine learning algorithms.
# Scenario: The system should incorporate machine learning algorithms to improve performance and accuracy in data analysis

# To implement machine learning algorithms, we can use the scikit-learn library.
# We can use the "train_test_split" function to split the data into training and testing sets.
# Then, we can use the "fit" method to train the model on the training data.
# Finally, we can use the "predict" method to make predictions on the testing data and evaluate the model's performance.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load and preprocess the data
X, y = load_data()
X = preprocess_data(X)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)

# Feature: Task assignment.
# Scenario: The system should allow tasks to be assigned to specific team members.

# To implement task assignment, we can use the "assign" function from the "itertools" library.
# This function will take in a list of tasks and a list of team members, and assign each task to a team member in a round-robin fashion.

from itertools import cycle

def assign(tasks, team_members):
    return {task: team_member for task, team_member in zip(tasks, cycle(team_members))}

tasks = ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3', 'Task 4']
team_members = ['John', 'Mike', 'Sarah', 'Emily']

task_assignment = assign(tasks, team_members)

# Feature: Task tracking and progress
# Scenario: The system should be able to understand and interpret natural language, and accurately identify the specific tasks and actions required.

# To implement task tracking and progress, we can use the "nltk" library for natural language processing.
# We can use the "word_tokenize" function to tokenize the input text and extract important keywords.
# Then, we can use these keywords to identify the specific tasks and actions required.

import nltk

def track_progress(text):
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    # Identify keywords and extract relevant information
    # ...
    return tasks, actions, progress

# Feature: Integration with project management tools.
# Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with popular project management tools such as Jira.

# To integrate with project management tools, we can use the "jira" library.
# We can use the "create_issue" function to create a new issue and assign it to a specific project and team member.
# We can also use the "update_issue" function to update the issue's status and progress.

from jira import JIRA

# Connect to Jira
jira_client = JIRA('https://jira.example.com', basic_auth=('username', 'password'))

# Create a new issue
issue = jira_client.create_issue(project='PROJECT', summary='New Task', assignee='John')

# Update the issue's status and progress
jira_client.transition_issue(issue, 'In Progress')
issue.update(summary='Task in progress')

# Feature: Metrics and reports.
# Scenario: The system should automatically generate reports to identify code complexity, test coverage, and performance metrics.

# To generate reports, we can use the "codeclimate" library.
# We can use the "analyze" function to analyze the code and generate a report with information on code complexity, test coverage, and performance metrics.

import codeclimate

# Analyze the code and generate a report
report = codeclimate.analyze()

# Feature: Integration with development environment.
# Scenario: The system should provide information on code complexity, test coverage, and performance bottlenecks in the development environment.

# To integrate with development environment, we can use the "pylint" library.
# We can use the "run" function to run pylint on the code and get a detailed report with information on code complexity, test coverage, and performance bottlenecks.

import pylint

# Run pylint and get a report
report = pylint.run()

# Feature: Report generation.
# Scenario: The system should generate reports based on user-specified criteria and data from the database.

# To generate reports, we can use the "pandas" library for data analysis.
# We can use the "read_sql" function to read data from the database and use pandas functions to filter and manipulate the data.
# Then, we can use the "to_csv" function to export the data to a CSV file for report generation.

import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')

# Read data from the database
data = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM table', conn)

# Filter and manipulate the data
# ...
# Export the data to a CSV file
data.to_csv('report.csv')

# Feature: User-friendly interface.
# Scenario: The Code Generation Engine should have a user-friendly interface to allow users to easily generate Python code.

# To create a user-friendly interface, we can use the "PySimpleGUI" library.
# We can use the "Window" and "Button" classes to create a simple GUI with a button that generates Python code.

import PySimpleGUI as sg

# Define the GUI layout
layout = [[sg.Text('Click the button to generate Python code')],
          [sg.Button('Generate Code')]]

# Create the window
window = sg.Window('Code Generation Engine', layout)

# Event loop to process "events" and get the "values" of inputs
while True:
    event, values = window.Read()
    # Check for the "Generate Code" button being clicked
    if event == 'Generate Code':
        # Generate Python code
        code = generate_code()
        # Display the code in a pop-up window
        sg.Popup('Generated code:', code)
    elif event is None:
        break

window.Close()

# Feature: Collaboration and project management.
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple developers to collaborate on a project and manage tasks and progress.

# To implement collaboration and project management, we can use the "git" library for version control.
# We can use the "clone" function to clone the project repository and use the "pull" and "push" functions to update the repository with changes from other developers.

from git import Repo

# Clone the project repository
repo = Repo.clone_from('https://github.com/username/project.git', 'local_repo')

# Make changes to the code
# ...

# Commit and push changes to the remote repository
repo.index.add(['modified_file.py'])
repo.index.commit('Updated code')
origin = repo.remote()
origin.push()

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should be able to track changes and provide detailed reports on any errors or bugs found during testing.

# To integrate with version control systems, we can use the "pytest" library for automated testing.
# We can use the "run" function to run the tests and get a report with information on any errors or bugs found.

import pytest

# Run pytest and get a report
report = pytest.run()

# Feature: Code refactoring.
# Scenario: The system should be able to identify and suggest improvements for code quality.

# To implement code refactoring, we can use the "autopep8" library.
# We can use the "fix_code" function to automatically fix any issues with code formatting and style.

import autopep8

# Fix code formatting and style
fixed_code = autopep8.fix_code(code)

# Feature: Code completion and suggestions.
# Scenario: While writing Python code, the system should provide code completion and suggestions to improve efficiency and accuracy.

# To provide code completion and suggestions, we can use the "jedi" library.
# We can use the "Script" class to analyze the code and provide suggestions for auto-completion and error correction.

import jedi

# Analyze the code and get suggestions
suggestions = jedi.Script(code).completions()
