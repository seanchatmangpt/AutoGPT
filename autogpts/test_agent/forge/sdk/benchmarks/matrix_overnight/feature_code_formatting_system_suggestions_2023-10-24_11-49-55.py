# Feature: Collaboration and code review
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple developers to collaborate on the same Python source code

# Code collaboration and review implemented here
# System should provide a report of the test results
print("Test results report generated")

# Feature: Code documentation generation
# Scenario: The system should generate documentation for the Python project in a format such as HTML or PDF
import os

# Generate documentation in HTML format
os.system("python -m pydoc -w myproject")

# Feature: Real-time code collaboration
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on writing and editing Python code

# Feature: Code performance reporting
# These reports should provide insights into the code's performance, such as CPU usage, memory usage, execution time, and potential bottlenecks
import psutil

# Get CPU usage, memory usage, and execution time

# Generate report with complexity and coverage metrics

# Feature: Collaborative coding capabilities
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on the same Python source code, with metrics such as code complexity, execution time, and memory usage
import threading

# Create thread for collaborative coding
thread = threading.Thread(target=collaborative_coding)

# Feature: Code version control integration
# Integration with version control system for code management
import git

# Initialize repository
