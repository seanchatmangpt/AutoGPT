# Debugging tools for Python code
# The IDE should provide tools for debugging Python code, such as setting breakpoints and
# inspecting variables

import pdb  # import the built-in debugger module

# Automatic code documentation generation
# When a code file is saved, the system should automatically generate documentation for the
# code based on docstrings and annotations

import pydoc  # import the built-in documentation generator

# Generate test cases
# The system should automatically generate test cases based on the task descriptions and code annotations

import unittest  # import the built-in unit testing framework

# Automated code review
# The system should automatically review Python code for common errors and suggest improvements for better code quality

import flake8  # import the code quality checker

# Task scheduling and assignment
# The system should allow users to schedule tasks and assign them to specific team members

from datetime import datetime  # import the datetime module for task scheduling
from collections import (
    namedtuple,
)  # import the namedtuple function for assigning tasks to team members

# Integration with test automation tools
# The system should integrate with test automation tools to provide performance metrics and reports

import pytest  # import the test automation framework
from performance import (
    PerformanceTracker,
)  # import the custom PerformanceTracker class for performance metrics

# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho
# This should include information such as code complexity, execution time, and memory usage,
# as well as suggestions for improving performance

import psutil  # import the psutil library for system performance metrics
from performance import (
    PerformanceAnalyzer,
)  # import the custom PerformanceAnalyzer class for analyzing performance data
