# Feature: Debugging

# This feature should be able to identify and suggest improvements such as removing duplicate code, optimizing loops, and suggesting better data structures. This can include renaming variables, extracting methods, and other code optimizations.

# This includes eliminating unnecessary code, improving readability, and implementing best practices such as multi-threading where applicable.
