# Feature: Code Structure and Readability
# Scenario: The system should provide suggestions for improving code structure and readability.

# Use docstrings to provide documentation for functions and classes
# Use meaningful variable and function names
# Use list comprehensions and generator expressions instead of map and filter functions
# Use the ternary operator instead of if/else statements in expressions
# Use context managers to manage resources and ensure proper cleanup

# Feature: Time tracking and reporting
# Scenario: The system should track the time spent on each task and generate reports for analysis and

# Use the timeit module for timing code execution
# Use the datetime module for tracking date and time information
# Use a dictionary to store task information, with task names as keys and time spent as values
# Use the json module to save task information to a file for future analysis and reporting

# Feature: Collaboration tools for team projects
# Scenario: The system should provide tools for team members to collaborate on a project, such

# Use version control software such as Git for collaboration and project management
# Use the built-in subprocess module to run Git commands directly from Python
# Use the argparse module to create a command line interface for managing the project and collaborating with team members
# Use the built-in logging module to record and track changes made by team members

# Feature: Task completion tracking
# Scenario: The system should allow users to mark tasks as completed and track their progress.

# Use a dictionary to store task information, with task names as keys and completion status as values
# Use a function to update the completion status of a task
# Use the built-in sum function to track the overall progress of the project based on the completion status of tasks

# Feature: Create task dependencies
# Scenario: The system should allow users to specify dependencies between tasks, so that they can be

# Use a dictionary to store task information, with task names as keys and a list of dependencies as values
# Use the built-in zip function and list comprehension to iterate through and process dependencies
# Use a function to check for circular dependencies and prevent infinite loops

# Feature: Test coverage report generation
# Scenario: The system should be able to generate a test coverage report for the Python project,

# Use a testing framework such as pytest or unittest to write and run tests for the project
# Use the coverage module to track test coverage
# Use the built-in subprocess module to run coverage commands directly from Python
# Use the built-in os module to navigate and manipulate files and directories for reporting and analysis
