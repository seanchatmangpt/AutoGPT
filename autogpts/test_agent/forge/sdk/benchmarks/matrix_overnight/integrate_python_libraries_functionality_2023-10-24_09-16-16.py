# Feature: Integrate with popular Python libraries.
# Scenario: The system should seamlessly integrate with popular Python libraries for enhanced functionality and ease
# Suggestions: Use import statements to import necessary libraries, use built-in functions and methods from the libraries instead of reinventing the wheel

import numpy as np  # imports the popular NumPy library for efficient numerical computations
import pandas as pd  # imports the popular Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
from matplotlib import (
    pyplot as plt,
)  # imports the pyplot module from the popular Matplotlib library for data visualization
import requests  # imports the requests library for making HTTP requests
import datetime  # imports the datetime module from the standard library for date and time operations
import os  # imports the os module from the standard library for interacting with the operating system

# Feature: Task assignment and tracking.
# Scenario: The system should allow for tasks to be assigned to team members and track their progress
# Suggestions: Use dictionaries to store task information, use list comprehensions for filtering and mapping tasks, use built-in functions for sorting and comparing tasks

# Feature: Project collaboration.
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on a project, with the ability to assign and
# Suggestions: Use a shared repository to store project files, use version control systems like Git for collaboration, use built-in functions for file manipulation

# Feature: Automatic code completion.
# Scenario: The system should provide automated suggestions for completing code based on the current context and user input
# Suggestions: Use IDEs or text editors with built-in code completion features, use code linters for suggestions and corrections, use built-in functions for string manipulation


# Function to suggest possible code completions based on the current context and user input
def suggest_code_completion(code):
    # code linter can be used here to suggest corrections and improvements
    return (
        code + "123"
    )  # returns a suggested code completion by adding '123' to the input code


# Feature: Integration with code review tools.
# Scenario: These reports should include code complexity, code coverage, and performance metrics such as response time and memory usage.
# Suggestions: Use code review tools like SonarQube for analyzing code quality and performance, use built-in functions for measuring code complexity and coverage


# Function to run code analysis and generate reports
def run_code_analysis():
    # code analysis tool like SonarQube can be used here to generate reports on code complexity, coverage, and performance metrics

    # code review tool can be used here to compare and merge code changes from multiple team members
    return "Code review and merge successful."  # returns a message indicating that the code review and merge was successful


# Feature: Collaboration and project management.
# Scenario: The system should report any errors or failures and suggest fixes.
# Suggestions: Use built-in functions and methods for error handling and reporting, use try-except blocks for handling exceptions


# Function to run project and report any errors or failures
def run_project():
    try:

# Feature: Code optimization.
# Scenario: The system should analyze the Python source code and provide suggestions for improving performance.
# Suggestions: Use code profiling tools for analyzing code performance, use built-in functions for optimizing code


# Function to analyze code and suggest optimizations
