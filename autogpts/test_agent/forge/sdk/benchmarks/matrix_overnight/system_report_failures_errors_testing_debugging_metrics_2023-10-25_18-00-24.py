'''
The system should report any failures or errors found during testing and debugging.
The generated code should be in a readable and maintainable format with proper indentation and comments.
These metrics and reports should include information such as execution time, memory usage, and other relevant performance data.
This includes code complexity, code coverage, and other performance metrics to help identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.

Feature: Integration with version control systems. Scenario: The system should integrate with popular version control systems such as Git, SVN,
Feature: Team collaboration and communication. Scenario: The system should provide a platform for team members to communicate and collaborate on tasks
Feature: Automated testing. Scenario: The system should automatically run unit tests on the Python source code to ensure functionality and catch any
