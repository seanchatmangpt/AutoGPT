# Feature: Code collaboration and version control
# Scenario: The system should allow users to collaborate on code and track changes using version control.

# Feature: Integration with version control systems
# Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with popular version control systems such as GitHub.

# Feature: Task organization and prioritization
# Scenario: The system should allow users to organize and prioritize tasks based on due date.

# Feature: Automatic code optimization suggestions
# Scenario: The system should provide suggestions for optimizing code, based on the latest coding standards and guidelines.

# Feature: Performance reports
# Scenario: The system should generate reports with measures such as code complexity, code coverage, execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage.

# Feature: Continuous performance tracking
# Scenario: The system should track performance over time to identify areas of improvement.
