# Feature: Error handling and debugging
# Scenario: The system should be able to detect and handle errors in the code automatically without the need for manual intervention from the programmer.
# It should also suggest changes to improve readability and maintainability.

import logging

# Set logging level to debug
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)


# Function to perform error handling and debugging
def handle_errors(code):
    try:
        # Execute the given code
        exec(code)
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error
        logging.error(e)
        # Handle error
        # ...


# Feature: Code review and feedback.
# Scenario: The system should provide a way for users to request code review and receive feedback.

# TODO: Add code review and feedback functionality using a code review tool or service


# Feature: Code completion and suggestion.
# Scenario: The system should provide suggestions and auto-completion for code based on the context.

# TODO: Add code completion and suggestion functionality using a code editor or IDE


# Feature: Automated testing and test coverage collection.
# Scenario: The system should have the ability to automatically run tests and collect code coverage reports.
# These reports should include information such as execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage.
# The system should also offer visualization options for code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks.

import unittest
import coverage

# Create coverage object
cov = coverage.Coverage()


# Function to run tests and collect code coverage
def run_tests():
    # Start code coverage
    cov.start()

    # Run tests
    unittest.main()

    # Stop code coverage
    cov.stop()

    # Save code coverage report
    cov.save()

    # Generate code coverage report
    cov.report()

    # Generate HTML code coverage report
    cov.html_report()

    # Generate XML code coverage report
    cov.xml_report()


# Feature: User authentication.
# Scenario: Users should be able to create an account and log in to the system with their credentials.

# TODO: Add user authentication functionality using a secure authentication library or service
