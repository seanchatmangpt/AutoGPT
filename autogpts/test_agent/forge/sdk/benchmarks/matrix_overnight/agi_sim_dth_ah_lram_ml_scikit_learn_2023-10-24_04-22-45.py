# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho.

# Feature: Implement machine learning algorithms.
# Scenario: The system should be able to train and apply various machine learning algorithms to analyze data
# Solution: Use scikit-learn library to implement machine learning algorithms.

from sklearn import linear_model, tree, ensemble

# Feature: Collaboration and communication tools.
# Scenario: The system should allow team members to collaborate and communicate on tasks and code changes,
# Solution: Use a collaborative platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

import git

# Feature: Team collaboration and communication.
# Scenario: The system should allow team members to collaborate and communicate effectively, such as through
# Solution: Use a communication tool such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Mattermost.

import slack

# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The system should be able to automatically run tests on the Python code to ensure functionality and
# Solution: Use a testing framework such as pytest, unittest, or doctest.

import pytest

# Feature: Integration with third-party APIs.
# Scenario: Given a request to retrieve data from a third-party API, the system
# Solution: Use a library such as requests to make API calls and retrieve data.

import requests

# Feature: Code version control integration.
# Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with a version control system, such as Git or SVN.
# Solution: Use a version control library such as gitpython or pysvn to manage code versions.

from git import Repo
import pysvn

# Feature: Automated code analysis and suggestions.
# Scenario: The system should analyze code and suggest improvements to code quality and performance.
# Solution: Use a code analysis tool such as pylint, pycodestyle, or flake8.

import pylint

# Feature: Error and failure reporting.
# Scenario: The system should provide detailed reports of any errors or failures in the code.
# Solution: Use a logging library such as logging or loguru to track and report errors.

import logging

# Feature: Code performance and complexity analysis.
# Scenario: The system should provide reports on code complexity, maintainability, and performance, and suggest ways to improve these metrics.
# Solution: Use a code metrics tool such as radon or mccabe to measure code complexity and performance.

import radon
import mccabe
