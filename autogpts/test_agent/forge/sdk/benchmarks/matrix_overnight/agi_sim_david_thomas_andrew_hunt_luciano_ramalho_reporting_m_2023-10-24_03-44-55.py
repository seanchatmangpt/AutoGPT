# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho.

# Feature: Reporting. Scenario: The system should generate reports with relevant metrics.

# Use the standard library and built-in functions unless specified otherwise.
# Use functional programming without classes.

# Example input:
# - 'reports'
#   - 'execution time'
#   - 'memory usage'
#   - 'other relevant metrics'
#   - 'Feature'
#   - 'code complexity'
#   - 'code coverage'
#   - 'performance benchmarks'
#   - 'Feature'
#   - 'Automated testing'
#   - 'Scenario'
#   - 'The system should have automated testing capabilities to ensure code changes do not introduce bugs or regressions'
#   - 'This includes renaming variables for clarity, removing redundant code, and optimizing loops and functions.'
#   - 'Feature'
#   - 'Integration with third-party APIs'
#   - 'Scenario'
#   - 'The system should be able to connect and retrieve data from external APIs such'
#   - 'Feature'
#   - 'User permissions management'
#   - 'Scenario'
#   - 'The system should allow administrators to set and modify user permissions for different features and functions'
