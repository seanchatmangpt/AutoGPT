# The code above is a Python implementation of the given input that aligns with the Pythonic practices advocated by Luciano Ramalho in "Fluent Python". It includes classes and functions that represent the various components of the system, such as task generation, task execution interface, system evaluation, and system update. The code follows Python's best practices and uses clear and concise naming conventions. It also includes docstrings that provide Design by Contract (DbC) information, specifying inputs, outputs, and behavior for each function. Please note that the implementation of the functions and methods inside the code is not provided, and you will need to define the specific logic and functionality based on your requirements.
