# Feature: Automatic code formatting.
# Scenario: The system should automatically format the generated Python code according to industry best practices and coding standards.

# Note: We can use the 'black' library to automatically format our code according to PEP8 standards. This library also has the advantage of being highly configurable, so we can adjust it to fit our specific coding style preferences.

# Import the 'black' library
import black

# Read in the input code
input_code = open("input.py").read()

# Format the code according to industry best practices and coding standards using the 'black' library
formatted_code = black.format_str(input_code, mode=black.FileMode())

# Output the formatted code
print(formatted_code)

# Feature: Code syntax highlighting.
# Scenario: The text editor should support syntax highlighting for Python code to improve readability and make it easier to identify errors.

# Note: We can use the 'pygments' library to add syntax highlighting to our code. This library supports a wide range of languages and output formats, including HTML, ANSI, and LaTeX.

# Import the 'pygments' library
import pygments

# Define the input code
input_code = """
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
"""

# Highlight the code using the 'pygments' library
highlighted_code = pygments.highlight(
    input_code,
    pygments.lexers.PythonLexer(),
    pygments.formatters.Terminal256Formatter(),
)

# Output the highlighted code
print(highlighted_code)

# Feature: Integration with project management tools.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular project management tools such as Trello, Asana, and JIRA.

# Note: We can use the 'py-trello' library to integrate our system with Trello. This library allows us to programmatically create and manage Trello boards, lists, and cards.

# Import the 'TrelloClient' class from the 'py-trello' library
from trello import TrelloClient

# Set up the Trello client using our API key and token
client = TrelloClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", token="YOUR_TOKEN")

# Create a new board
board = client.add_board("New Project")

# Create a new list on the board
list = board.add_list("To Do")

# Create a new card on the list
card = list.add_card("Add integration with Asana")

# Print the URL of the newly created card
print(card.url)

# Feature: User authentication.
# Scenario: Given a user's login credentials, the system should verify their identity and grant access to the system.

# Note: We can use the 'flask-login' library to handle user authentication in our system. This library provides user session management, password hashing, and other useful features for user authentication.

# Import the 'Flask' and 'login_manager' classes from the 'flask-login' library
from flask import Flask
from flask_login import LoginManager

# Initialize the Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize the login manager
login_manager = LoginManager()


# Configure the login manager to use a user_loader function
@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User.get(user_id)


# Create a login route
@app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])
def login():
    # Get the login credentials from the request
    username = request.form["username"]
    password = request.form["password"]

    # Verify the credentials
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    if user and user.check_password(password):
        # Log the user in
        login_user(user)
        return redirect(url_for("dashboard"))

    # If credentials are invalid, redirect to login page
    return redirect(url_for("login"))


# Feature: User authentication and authorization.
# Scenario: Users should be able to create accounts, log in, and access different features based on their role and permissions.

# Note: We can use the 'Flask-Principal' library to handle user authentication and authorization in our system. This library allows us to define roles and permissions for users and restrict access to certain routes based on those roles and permissions.

# Import the 'Flask' and 'Principal' classes from the 'flask-principal' library
from flask import Flask
from flask_principal import (
    Principal,
    Permission,
    RoleNeed,
    identity_loaded,
    Identity,
    identity_changed,
)

# Initialize the Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize the principal
principal = Principal(app)

# Define the different roles and permissions for our system
roles = {"admin": Permission(RoleNeed("admin")), "user": Permission(RoleNeed("user"))}


# Create a login route
@app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])
def login():
    # Get the login credentials from the request
    username = request.form["username"]
    password = request.form["password"]

    # Verify the credentials
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
    if user and user.check_password(password):
        # Log the user in
        identity_changed.send(app, identity=Identity(user.id))

        # Redirect to appropriate page based on user's role
        if user.role == "admin":
            return redirect(url_for("admin_dashboard"))
        else:
            return redirect(url_for("user_dashboard"))

    # If credentials are invalid, redirect to login page
    return redirect(url_for("login"))


# Feature: Code performance metrics and reports.
# Scenario: These reports should provide insights into the code's performance, such as memory usage, execution time, and bottlenecks.

# Note: We can use the 'line_profiler' library to profile our code and generate reports with performance metrics. This library allows us to identify bottlenecks in our code and optimize it for better performance.

# Import the 'line_profiler' library
import line_profiler


# Define a function to profile
def add(a, b):
    return a + b


# Run the profiler on the function
profile = line_profiler.LineProfiler()
profile.add_function(add)
profile.runcall(add, 1, 2)

# Print the performance report
profile.print_stats()

# Feature: Code quality and maintainability metrics and reports.
# Scenario: These metrics should include code complexity, code coverage, and runtime performance. Additionally, the reports should provide recommendations for improvement and highlight potential issues in the code.

# Note: We can use the 'radon' and 'coverage' libraries to generate reports with code quality and maintainability metrics. These libraries provide metrics such as code complexity, code coverage, and code duplication, and allow us to identify potential issues in our code and improve its overall quality.

# Import the 'radon' and 'coverage' libraries
import radon
import coverage

# Generate a complexity report for a given file
complexity_report = radon.complexity.cc_visit("my_code.py")

# Print the report
print(complexity_report)

# Generate a coverage report for a given file
coverage_report = coverage.Coverage()
coverage_report.set_option("pylibpcov", "True")
coverage_report.start()
coverage_report.stop()
coverage_report.report(file="my_code.py")

# Print the report
print(coverage_report)
