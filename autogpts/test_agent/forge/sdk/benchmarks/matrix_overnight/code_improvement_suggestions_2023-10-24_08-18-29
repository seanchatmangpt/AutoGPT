  - This could include simplifying complex code, removing unused variables or imports,
    and optimizing loops and functions.
  - It should also provide suggestions for code improvement and automatically make
    the changes with user approval.

  - These metrics and reports should provide insights into the code's performance,
    such as execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage.

  - This will help identify areas of the code that are performing poorly and suggest
    improvements.
