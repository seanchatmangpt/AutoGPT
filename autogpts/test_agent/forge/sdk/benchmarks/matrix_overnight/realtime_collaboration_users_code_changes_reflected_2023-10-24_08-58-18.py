# Feature: Real-time collaboration
# Scenario: Users should be able to collaborate on code in real-time, with changes being reflected immediately
# Given that users are collaborating on the same codebase
# When a user makes a change to the code
# Then the changes should be immediately reflected for all other users

# Feature: Task prioritization
# Scenario: The system should allow users to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance
# Given a list of tasks with different levels of urgency and importance
# When the system is prompted to prioritize the tasks
# Then the tasks should be rearranged in order of highest urgency and importance to lowest

# These reports should include information on code complexity, test coverage, and other performance indicators
# Given a codebase
# When a report is generated
# Then the report should include information on code complexity, test coverage, and other performance indicators

# These reports should include information such as execution time, memory usage, and potential bottlenecks
# Given a codebase
# When a report is generated
# Then the report should include information such as execution time, memory usage, and potential bottlenecks

# This should include information such as code coverage, cyclomatic complexity, and lines of code
# Given a codebase
# When a report is generated
# Then the report should include information such as code coverage, cyclomatic complexity, and lines of code

# These metrics and reports should include code complexity, runtime performance, memory usage, and other relevant performance indicators
# Given a codebase
# When metrics and reports are generated
# Then they should include code complexity, runtime performance, memory usage, and other relevant performance indicators

# The generated code should be syntactically correct and follow the programming best practices
# Given a system that generates code
# When the code is generated
# Then it should be syntactically correct and follow best practices

# Feature: Integration with popular Python libraries
# Given a database schema
# When the system is prompted to generate Python code
# Then the code should be generated to interact with the database, including necessary classes

# It should allow users to input their requirements and generate corresponding features and scenarios for the Python code
# Given user requirements
# When the system is prompted to generate features and scenarios for the code
# Then the corresponding features and scenarios should be generated

# Given a database schema
# When the system generates Python code to interact with the database
# Then the code should be able to interact with the database

# It should provide feedback on any errors or failures in the code
# Given a codebase
# When the system runs tests on the code
# Then it should provide feedback on any errors or failures in the code

# Feature: Collaboration and version control
# Scenario: The system should allow for collaboration and version control
# Given a team working on a codebase using the system
# When changes are made to the code
# Then the system should track the changes and allow for collaboration and version control

# It should also provide detailed reports on the results of the tests and any errors encountered
# Given a codebase
# When the system runs tests on the code
# Then it should provide detailed reports on the results of the tests and any errors encountered
