# Feature: Database schema mapping
# Scenario: Generate Python code for database interaction
# Given a database schema
# When the system generates

# Feature: Task assignment and tracking
# Scenario: Users should be able to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should allow users to connect their code repositories (such as Git)

# Feature: Automatic task assignment
# Scenario: The system should automatically assign tasks to team members based on their skills, availability, and workload.

# Feature: Code review and collaboration
# Scenario: The system should allow for code review and collaboration among team members, with the ability to offer suggestions for improvements and allow the user to review and approve the changes before implementing them. It should also offer suggestions for improving code readability and maintainability.

# Feature: Report generation
# Scenario: The system should generate reports on code complexity, test coverage, and performance. These reports should include information such as execution time, memory usage, and any potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the code.

# Feature: Integration with continuous integration tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with continuous integration tools to provide automated testing, code quality checks, and performance monitoring. These reports should include information on code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks.
