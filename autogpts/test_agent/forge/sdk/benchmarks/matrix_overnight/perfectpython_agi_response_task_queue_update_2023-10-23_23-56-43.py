# Feature: Adaptively update the system based on evaluation results

# 1. Use a Task Queue: One way to continuously loop back to task generation is by using a task queue. This
#    ensures that new tasks are generated as soon as the previous tasks are completed.
#    Example code:
from queue import Queue

task_queue = Queue()

while True:
    task = generate_task()  # function to generate a new task
    task_queue.put(task)

    # process the task
    process_task(task)
```

```python
# Architecture:

# 1. Input Module: This module will take in the coding task to be solved as input from the user
#    and provide it to the AGI simulation module.

# 2. AGI Simulation Module: This module will evaluate the given code against the task requirements
#    and generate an appropriate response.

# 3. Task Dashboard: The task dashboard provides the user with an overview of all the tasks that
#    can be executed. It allows them to select a task and view its details.

# 4. Task Execution Interface: This user interface component allows the user to interact with the
#    AGI simulator and execute the selected task.

# 5. State Manager: This component manages the state of the system, ensuring that the system loops
#    back to task generation after each cycle.

# 6. Metrics and Reporting: This component collects and reports metrics on the user's performance and
#    skill development.

# 7. Task Generation: This component is responsible for generating coding tasks for the AGI system
#    based on the user's progress and performance.
