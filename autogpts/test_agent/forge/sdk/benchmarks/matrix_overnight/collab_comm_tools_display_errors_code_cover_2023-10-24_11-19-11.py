# Collaboration and Communication Tools:
# The system should have collaboration and communication tools such as project boards, chat, and
# display results to the user
# If any errors or failures occur, the system should display detailed information to help the developer fix the issue.

# Code Coverage:
# The system should have the ability to measure code coverage.

# Code Review and Feedback:
# The system should allow for code review and provide feedback to improve code quality and identify
# unused variables, simplify complex logic, and improve code readability.
# It should also be able to fix potential security vulnerabilities and suggest improvements to the code structure.

# Integration with Build and Deployment Tools:
# The system should integrate with build and deployment tools to provide insights into the code's performance,
# such as execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage.
# These reports should include code complexity, code coverage, code quality metrics, and potential performance issues.

# Task Assignment and Tracking:
# The system should allow users to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.

# Team Collaboration and Communication:
# The system should provide a messaging platform for team members to discuss tasks and updates.

# Automated Testing:
# The system should have the ability to run automated tests on the codebase to ensure functionality.
