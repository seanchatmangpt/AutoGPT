# Feature: Adaptive System Update

# Scenario: Updating the System Based on Evaluation Results

# Given the system has been evaluated with AG

# One possible way to manage the state of the system in order to continuously loop back to task generation after each cycle is by using a loop structure.

# Define a function to generate tasks based on evaluation results and continuously loop back to task generation:
def generate_tasks():
    while True:
        # Task generation logic
        pass

# Feature: Adaptive System Update

# Scenario: Evaluate System Performance

# Given a system that generates tasks

# When the system completes a task

# Implement a Task Queue to manage the state of the system and ensure it continuously loops back to task generation after each cycle:
class TaskQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def add_task(self, task):
        self.queue.append(task)

    def start(self):
        while self.queue:
            task = self.queue.pop(0)
            # Task execution logic
            pass

# Feature: Adaptive Task Generation

# As a system,

# I want to adaptively update my task generation based on evaluation results

# Use a state variable to manage the state of the system and ensure it continuously loops back to task generation after each cycle:
state = True

# Define a function to generate tasks based on the state and continuously loop back to task generation:
def generate_tasks():
    while state:
        # Task generation logic
        pass

# Algorithm: Evaluate Python Code Against Task Requirements

# Input:
# - Python code to be evaluated
# - Task's requirements

# Output:
# - Evaluation of code against requirements

# Define a function to evaluate Python code against task requirements:
def evaluate_code(python_code, task_requirements):
    # Evaluation logic
    pass

# Architecture:

# The closed-loop system for Python coding tasks would consist of several components working together to create a seamless and efficient system.

# User Interface:

# The user interface would consist of a simple and clean design with a menu bar at the top.

# Create a user-friendly interface for task execution:
class TaskExecutionInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.menu = []

    def add_menu_option(self, option):
        self.menu.append(option)

    def execute_task(self, task):
        # Task execution logic
        pass       

# Feature: Adaptive System Updates

# Scenario: Evaluate System Performance

# Given the system has completed a task

# When the task is evaluated

# Implement a loop structure to manage the state of the system and ensure it continuously loops back to task generation after each cycle:
while True:
    # Task evaluation logic
    pass

# Feature: Adaptive System Update

# Scenario: Evaluate system performance

# Given the system has been running for a period of time

# Implement a loop structure to manage the state of the system and ensure it continuously loops back to task generation after each cycle:
while True:
    # Task generation and evaluation logic
    pass

# Feature: Adaptively Update System Based on Evaluation Results

# Scenario: Update Internal State and Guide Future Task Generation

# Given a system that generates tasks

# When the system completes a task

# Use a loop structure to manage the state of the system and ensure it continuously loops back to task generation after each cycle:
while True:
    # Task generation and evaluation logic
    pass

# Feature: Adaptive System Update

# In order to improve system performance

# As a developer

# I want to adaptively update the system based on evaluation results

# Use a While loop to manage the state of the system and ensure it continuously loops back to task generation after each cycle:
while True:
    # Task generation and evaluation logic
    pass
