# Feature: User Management

# Scenario: Creating a new user
# Given a user with administrator privileges
# When the administrator creates a


def create_user(user, admin):
    if admin:
        # create new user
        return True
    else:
        # return error message
        return "Unauthorized user, administrator privileges required"


# Feature: Debugging breakpoints
# Scenario: The interactive console should allow users to set breakpoints in their code, allowing them to

import pdb

# code with breakpoints
pdb.set_trace()

# Feature: Create user-friendly GUI for the system
# Scenario: The system should design and implement a graphical user interface that is

# import GUI library
from tkinter import *

# create GUI window
window = Tk()

# add GUI elements
label = Label(window, text="Welcome to the System")
button = Button(window, text="Click Me")

# display GUI elements
label.pack()
button.pack()
window.mainloop()

# Feature: Version control for code changes
# Scenario: The system should track and store all changes made to the Python code, allowing

# import version control library
import git

# initialize repository
repo = git.Repo()

# add files to repository
repo.git.add("file1.py")
repo.git.add("file2.py")

# commit changes
repo.git.commit("-m", "Code changes")

# Feature: Project collaboration
# Scenario: The system should allow for multiple users to collaborate on a project, with the ability to assign

# import collaboration library
import socket

# create server
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# connect to server
server.connect(("127.0.0.1", 8000))

# send data to server
server.send(b"Hello, world!")

# receive data from server
data = server.recv(1024)

# close connection
server.close()

# The system should be able to generate reports on code complexity, code coverage, and performance of the application.
# These reports should provide insights into the code's execution time, memory usage, and other performance metrics.
# These reports should also highlight

# import reporting library
import cProfile

# run code with profiler
cProfile.run("my_function()")

# Feature: AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho.
# Scenario: The system should simulate artificial general intelligence using the principles taught by David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, and Luciano Ramalho

# import AGI library
import openai

# initialize AGI model
model = openai.GPT3()

# provide input
input = "Hello, World!"

# generate response
response = model.generate(input)

# display response
print(response)
