# AGI simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho

# Feature: Real-time collaboration
# Scenario: Multiple users should be able to work on the same codebase simultaneously and see each other

# Feature: Integration with version control systems
# Scenario: The system should seamlessly integrate with Git and other version control systems, allowing users
# to manage and track changes to their codebase.

# Feature: Code completion and suggestion
# Scenario: The IDE should provide suggestions and auto-completion for code based on the current context.

# Feature: Code testing and debugging
# Scenario: The system should provide a built-in testing and debugging tool to help developers identify and
# resolve errors in their code.

# Feature: Debugging tools
# Scenario: The system should have tools for debugging Python code, such as a debugger and error reporting,
# to improve the development process.

# Feature: User authentication
# Scenario: Upon successful login, the user should be redirected to the home page and have access to the system's
# features and resources.

# Feature: Customizable reports
# Scenario: The system should generate reports with information on code complexity, code coverage, and performance
# benchmarks. Users should also be able to customize and schedule these reports.
