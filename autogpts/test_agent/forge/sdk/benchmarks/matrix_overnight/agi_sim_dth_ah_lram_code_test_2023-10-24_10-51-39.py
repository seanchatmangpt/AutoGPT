# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt,Luciano Ramahlo.
# This code is used to simulate artificial general intelligence and its capabilities.

# Feature: Code testing.
# Scenario: The system should have the ability to run automated tests on the generated code to ensure functionality and reliability.

# Use the unittest library for automated testing
import unittest


# Define a test class for the code
class TestCode(unittest.TestCase):
    # Test case for ensuring functionality of the generated code
    def test_functionality(self):
        # Code for testing the functionality of the generated code
        pass

    # Test case for ensuring reliability of the generated code
    def test_reliability(self):
        # Code for testing the reliability of the generated code
        pass


# Feature: Collaboration and code review.
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to collaborate on the same codebase and provide feedback on any errors or failures encountered during the testing process.

# Use the code review library for collaboration and feedback
import codereview


# Define a code review function for collaborative code review
def code_review(code):
    # Code for collaborating and providing feedback on the code
    pass


# Feature: Code refactoring and optimization.
# Scenario: The system should display the results of the tests and any errors or failures encountered.

# Use the pytest library for code refactoring and optimization
import pytest


# Define a test function for displaying the results of the tests and any errors or failures encountered
def display_test_results():
    # Code for displaying test results and errors/failures
    pass


# Feature: Project management dashboard.
# Scenario: The system should provide a dashboard displaying project progress, task status, and team member contributions.

# Use the project management library for project management and dashboard creation
import projectmanagement


# Define a function for creating a project management dashboard
def create_dashboard():
    # Code for creating a dashboard displaying project progress, task status, and team member contributions
    pass


# Feature: Integration with task management tools.
# Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with popular task management tools.

# Use the task management library for integration with popular tools
import taskmanagement


# Define a function for integrating with task management tools
def integrate_with_tools():
    # Code for integrating with task management tools
    pass


# Feature: User authentication.
# Scenario: The system should allow users to create accounts and login with a username and password.

# Use the user authentication library for user account creation and login
import userauthentication


# Define functions for creating user accounts and logging in
def create_account():
    # Code for creating user accounts
    pass


def login(username, password):
    # Code for user login
    pass


# Feature: Monitoring and reporting.
# Scenario: The system should provide metrics and reports on the performance of the generated code.

# Use the monitoring and reporting library for gathering and analyzing performance metrics
import monitoringreporting


# Define a function for gathering and analyzing performance metrics
def gather_performance_metrics():
    # Code for gathering and analyzing performance metrics
    pass


# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should provide reports on the performance of the code.

# Use the version control library for integration and reporting
import versioncontrol


# Define a function for generating performance reports
def generate_performance_reports():
    # Code for generating performance reports
    pass
