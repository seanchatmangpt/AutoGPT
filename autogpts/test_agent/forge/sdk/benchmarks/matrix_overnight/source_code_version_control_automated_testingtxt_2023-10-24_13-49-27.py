# Feature: Source code version control
# Scenario: The system should be able to provide suggestions for fixes if any errors or failures are detected
# Feature: Automated testing
# Scenario: The system should be able to automatically run tests on the code and report any errors or failures
# Feature: Integration with version control systems
# Scenario: The system should be able to seamlessly integrate with popular version control systems
# Feature: User authentication
# Scenario: The system should allow users to create accounts and login to access project features
# Feature: Project collaboration
# These reports should provide insights into the performance of the code, such as execution time, memory usage, and potential bottlenecks
# These reports should include information such as execution time, memory usage, and any potential bottlenecks in the code
# These reports should include information such as code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks
# These metrics and reports should include but are not limited to code complexity, test coverage, and code quality
# Given a database schema, the system should generate Python code to interact with the database
# Feature: Debugging
# Scenario: The system should allow users to debug their Python code by setting breakpoints and stepping through the code
