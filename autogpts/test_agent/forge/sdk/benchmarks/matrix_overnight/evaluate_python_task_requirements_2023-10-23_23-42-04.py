"""Evaluate Python Code against Task's Requirements

Input:
- Python code
- Task's requirements

Output:
- Evaluation result (pass/fail)

Steps:

1. Parse the task's requirements and extract the desired metrics for evaluation.
2. Compile the Python code to generate bytecode.
3. Execute the bytecode and capture any errors or exceptions.
4. Compare the captured results with the desired metrics.
5. Return the evaluation result based on the comparison.

Note: Make sure to handle any potential security risks or untrusted code by sandboxing the execution environment.
