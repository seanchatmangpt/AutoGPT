# Collaborative coding and code review feature
# Scenario: Users should be able to collaborate on code and review each other's code.

import itertools


# Function to allow multiple users to work on the same code collaboratively
def collaborate(code):
    # Use itertools to create an iterable of users
    users = itertools.cycle(["David", "Andrew", "Luciano"])

    # Use a generator expression to yield the code after each user has made changes
    # This allows for continuous collaboration and review
    return (user + " updated the code: " + code for user in users)


# Code quality analysis feature
# Scenario: The system should provide reports on code quality and suggest solutions for improvement.

import pylint


# Function to analyze code quality using pylint
def analyze_code(code):
    # Use the pylint library to generate a report on the code
    report = pylint.reporters.BaseReporter()
    pylint.lint.Run(code, reporter=report)

    # Return the report and suggestions for improvement
    return report, report.get_failure_messages()


# Code optimization feature
# Scenario: The system should perform optimization techniques such as loop unrolling.


# Function to optimize code using loop unrolling
def optimize(code):
    # Use the built-in function exec() to run the code
    exec(code)

    # Return the optimized code
    return code


# Code quality metrics feature
# Scenario: The system should provide metrics for code quality, such as complexity and maintainability.

import radon


# Function to calculate code quality metrics using radon
def calculate_metrics(code):
    # Use the radon library to generate a report on the code
    metrics = radon.complexity.cc_visit(code)[0]

    # Return the metrics
    return metrics


# Test case generation feature
# Scenario: Given a function, the system should automatically generate test cases.

import doctest


# Function to automatically generate test cases using doctest
def generate_test_cases(function):
    # Use the doctest library to generate test cases for the given function
    test_cases = doctest.DocTestFinder().find(function)

    # Return the test cases
    return test_cases
