def get_api_data(endpoint):
    # Make a GET request to the API endpoint
    response = requests.get(endpoint)

# Feature: Integration with version control systems. Scenario: The system should
# allow users to connect their code repositories from version control systems

# Use the GitPython library to interact with Git repositories
from git import Repo


# Define a function that clones a given Git repository to a specified local directory
def clone_git_repo(repo_url, local_dir):
    # Clone the repository to the specified local directory
    Repo.clone_from(repo_url, local_dir)
    # Return the cloned repository object
    return Repo(local_dir)


# Example usage: clone a repository from GitHub to a local directory "my_repo"
my_repo = clone_git_repo("https://github.com/username/my_repo.git", "my_repo")

# Feature: Collaboration and code review. Scenario: The system should allow
# users to collaborate on code and perform code reviews

# Use the GitHub API to create a new pull request for code review
import requests


# Define a function that creates a new pull request on a given repository with the specified base and head branches
def create_pull_request(repo, base_branch, head_branch, title, body):
    # Create a JSON payload with the necessary data
    payload = {"title": title, "body": body, "base": base_branch, "head": head_branch}
    # Make a POST request to the GitHub API with the JSON payload
    response = requests.post(f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/pulls", json=payload)
    # Return the response as JSON data
    return response.json()


# Example usage: create a new pull request from branch "feature" to branch "master" on repository "my_repo"
pull_request = create_pull_request(
    "my_repo",
    "master",
    "feature",
    "New Feature",
    "This pull request adds a new feature to the codebase",
)

# It should provide information about any errors or failures in the code.Feature:
# Collaboration and code review. Scenario: The system should allow

# Use the built-in logging module to log any errors or failures in the code
import logging

# Set the logging level to INFO
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Example usage: log an error message
logging.error("An error has occurred: Error message here")

# The reports should include information such as code complexity, test coverage,
# and performance benchmarks.

# Use the built-in unittest module to run and generate reports for unit tests
import unittest


# Define a class that inherits from the TestCase class and contains unit tests
class MyTests(unittest.TestCase):
    # Define a test method
    def test_something(self):
        # Test something and assert the result
        self.assertEqual(something, something)


# Use the built-in coverage module to generate coverage reports for the code
import coverage


# Define a function that runs the unit tests and generates a coverage report
def run_unit_tests():
    # Create a coverage object
    cov = coverage.Coverage()
    # Start the coverage analysis
    cov.start()
    # Run the unit tests
    unittest.main()
    # Stop the coverage analysis
    cov.stop()
    # Generate the coverage report
    cov.report()


# Example usage: run the unit tests and generate a coverage report
run_unit_tests()

# These reports should include details such as execution time, memory usage, and
# any potential bottlenecks that may be impacting performance.

# Use the built-in timeit module to measure execution time of code
import timeit


# Define a function that runs a given piece of code and returns the execution time
def measure_execution_time(code):
    # Measure the execution time of the code and return the result
    return timeit.timeit(code, number=1)


# Example usage: measure the execution time of a function call
execution_time = measure_execution_time("my_function()")

# This includes identifying areas of the code that may have performance issues,
# such as long execution times or high memory usage, and providing
# suggestions for optimization.

# Use the built-in cProfile module to profile code and identify performance issues
import cProfile


# Define a function that profiles a given piece of code and prints the results
def profile_code(code):
    # Create a cProfile object
    pr = cProfile.Profile()
    # Run the code inside the profiler
    pr.run(code)
    # Print the profiling results
    pr.print_stats()


# Example usage: profile a function call and print the results
profile_code("my_function()")

# These metrics and reports should provide insights into the performance of the
# code, such as execution time, memory usage, and code optimization.

# Use the built-in sys module to access system information and resources
import sys


# Define a function that prints the current memory usage and CPU usage
def print_system_metrics():
    # Get the current memory usage and CPU usage
    memory_usage = sys.getsizeof(object)
    cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent()
    # Print the metrics
    print(f"Memory usage: {memory_usage} bytes")
    print(f"CPU usage: {cpu_usage}%")


# Example usage: print the current system metrics
