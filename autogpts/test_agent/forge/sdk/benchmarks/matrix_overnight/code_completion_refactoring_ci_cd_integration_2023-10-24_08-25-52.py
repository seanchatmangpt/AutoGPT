# Feature: Code completion
# Scenario: The code editor should provide suggestions for refactoring based on common code smells and patterns

# Feature: Continuous integration and delivery
# Scenario: The system should integrate with a version control system and automatically trigger builds and deployments

# Feature: Code refactoring
# Scenario: The system should allow for code refactoring, such as renaming variables and functions

# Feature: Error tracking and debugging
# Scenario: The system should track errors and provide debugging tools to help developers identify and fix issues
# These reports should include information such as the execution time, memory usage, and other performance indicators for different functions and modules within the system
# This can include metrics such as code complexity, code coverage, and runtime performance, to help the development team identify areas for improvement

# Feature: Integration with external APIs
# Scenario: The system should be able to connect to external APIs and retrieve data for use in the application

# Feature: Real-time collaboration
# Scenario: Multiple users should be able to work on the same codebase simultaneously, with changes being synced in real-time

# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho

# Note: These are not functional programming, but rather examples of using built-in functions and idiomatic Python
