# Feature: Collaboration and version control.
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to work on the same codebase
# simultaneously and track changes made by each user.

# Use a version control system like Git to track changes and allow multiple users
# to collaborate on the codebase.


# Feature: Code review and error detection.
# Scenario: The system should analyze the Python source code and highlight any
# potential errors or coding style violations.

# Use a linter like Flake8 to analyze the code and flag any potential errors or
# style violations.


# Feature: Integration with project management tools.
# Scenario: The system should be able to seamlessly integrate with popular project
# management tools such as Trello and Jira.

# Use APIs provided by project management tools to integrate them with the system
# and allow for seamless collaboration between the two.


# The system should allow users to specify the metrics they want to track and the
# format of the reports.
# These reports should include code complexity, test coverage, and other relevant
# performance metrics.

# This will help developers identify areas for improvement and track the overall
# performance of their code.

# Use tools such as CodeClimate or SonarQube to track code metrics and identify
# areas for improvement and potential issues.
