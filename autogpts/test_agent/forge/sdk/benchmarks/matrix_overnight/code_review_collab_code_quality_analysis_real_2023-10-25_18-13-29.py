# Feature: Code review and collaboration
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple developers to review and collaborate on the Python source code

# Feature: Code quality analysis
# Scenario: The system should perform code quality analysis and provide suggestions for improvement

# Feature: Real-time collaboration

# Feature: Integration with popular programming languages
# Scenario: The system should support integration with popular programming languages such as Java, C++

# Feature: Data validation
# Scenario: The system should validate all user inputs to ensure they are in the correct format and within

# These metrics and reports should provide information on the code's performance,
# such as execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage.
# These metrics should include code complexity, code coverage, and execution time.

# Feature: Integration with code review tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with code review tools to provide metrics and reports on code quality and performance.

# Feature: User Profile Management
# Scenario: As a user, I want to be able to create and edit my profile information.
