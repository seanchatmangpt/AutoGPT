# A user-friendly interface for creating and managing features and scenarios
# Feature: Integration with version control systems
# Scenario: The system should be able to integrate with popular version control systems like Git

# Feature: Implement error handling in Python code
# Scenario: The system should add try/except blocks in the Python code to handle

# Code Generation Engine should be able to identify and map tables, columns, etc. from a given database schema

# Feature: Version Control Integration
# Scenario: The system should integrate with version control systems like Git to track changes and manage code

# The system should allow users to customize the metrics and reports generated, providing insights into code performance
# Feature: Collaborate with team members
# Scenario: The system should generate detailed reports on test results and any errors encountered during testing

# Report any errors or failures found during testing
# Provide detailed reports on test results and any errors encountered

# Import the necessary libraries
