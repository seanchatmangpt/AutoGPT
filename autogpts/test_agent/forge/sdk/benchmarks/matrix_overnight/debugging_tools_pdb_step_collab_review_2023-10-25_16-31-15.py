# Step-by-step execution
# Use the step command to step through code and the next command to execute the next line.
# Use the display command to view variables at each step.

# Collaboration and code review
# This feature will help users easily create tasks without needing to format them in a specific way.
# Collaboration and task assignment.
# This feature will allow users to easily input their tasks using natural language, making task management more efficient.

# Real-time collaboration
# Multiple users should be able to collaborate on the same project in real-time, with
# Automated task assignment based on team availability.
# The system should automatically assign tasks to team members based on their availability.
