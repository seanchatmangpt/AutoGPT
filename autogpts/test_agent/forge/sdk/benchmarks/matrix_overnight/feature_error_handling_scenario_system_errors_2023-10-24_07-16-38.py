# Feature: Error Handling.
# Scenario: The system should handle errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages to the user.

# Use the built-in 'try-except' statement to handle potential errors
try:
    # code to be executed
    pass
except Exception as e:  # catch any exception
    # handle the error gracefully
    print("An error has occurred:", str(e))

# Feature: Debugging tools for Python code.
# Scenario: The system should provide debugging tools such as breakpoints, step-through execution.

# Use the built-in 'pdb' module for debugging
import pdb

# set breakpoints at specific lines of code
pdb.set_trace()

# execute the code line by line using the 'step' command
pdb.step()

# Feature: Code optimization tools.
# Scenario: The system should provide tools for identifying and removing redundant code,
# suggesting better data structures, and improving algorithm complexity.

# Use the built-in 'timeit' module to measure execution time of a specific code snippet
import timeit

# use 'timeit' to measure the execution time of a code snippet
timeit.timeit("a = 1 + 2")

# use 'timeit' to compare the execution time of two different implementations
timeit.timeit("a = [i**2 for i in range(100)]")
timeit.timeit("a = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(100)))")

# Feature: Code readability and organization suggestions.
# Scenario: The system should provide suggestions for improving code readability and organization.

# Use the built-in 'pylint' module for static code analysis and suggestions
import pylint

# run 'pylint' on a specific file
pylint.run("my_code.py")

# Feature: Team collaboration and communication tools.
# Scenario: The system should provide a platform for team members to communicate and collaborate on code.

# Use the built-in 'git' module for version control and collaboration
import git

# clone a remote repository
git.clone("https://github.com/my_username/my_repo.git")

# pull changes from a remote repository
git.pull()

# push changes to a remote repository
git.push()

# Feature: User authentication.
# Scenario: The system should allow users to create accounts and log in with secure credentials.

# Use the built-in 'getpass' module for secure user input
import getpass

# prompt the user for a password without displaying it on the screen
password = getpass.getpass("Enter your password: ")

# Feature: Code performance tracking.
# Scenario: The system should provide reports on code complexity, code coverage, and other relevant performance metrics.

# Use the built-in 'coverage' module for code coverage analysis
import coverage

# run 'coverage' on a specific file
coverage.run("my_code.py")

# use 'coverage' to generate a report on code coverage
coverage.report()

# Feature: Integration with popular IDEs.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular IDEs to provide a seamless development experience.

# Use the built-in 'sys' module to check the current IDE being used
import sys

# check if the current IDE is PyCharm
if "pycharm" in sys.modules:
    # perform specific actions for PyCharm
    pass

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular version control systems like Git, allowing developers to track changes and collaborate.

# Use the built-in 'git' module for version control
import git

# check if a Git repository exists
if git.repo_exists("my_repo"):
    # perform specific actions for Git repositories
    pass

# Feature: Code performance tracking.
# Scenario: The system should provide reports on code complexity, code coverage, and function execution time.

# Use the built-in 'cProfile' module for code profiling
import cProfile

# run 'cProfile' on a specific function
cProfile.run("my_function()")

# use 'cProfile' to generate a report on function execution time
cProfile.run("my_function()", "my_report.txt")
