# Feature: Integrate with external API for data retrieval.
# Scenario: The system should be able to make API calls and retrieve data

import requests

# Define function to make API call and return data
def make_api_call(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

# Example API call
data = make_api_call("https://api.example.com/data")

# Feature: Error handling and debugging.
# Scenario: The system should provide clear error messages and debugging tools to assist developers in identifying and

# Define function to handle errors and print helpful messages
def handle_errors(error):
    print("An error has occurred: {}".format(error))

# Example error handling

# Feature: Real-time collaboration.
# Scenario: Multiple users should be able to work on the same task simultaneously and see updates in real

# Use a collaborative tool or library, such as Firebase or Socket.IO, to enable real-time collaboration between users working on the same task

# Feature: Export performance reports.
# Scenario: The system should be able to export performance reports for code complexity, test coverage, and other relevant performance indicators.

# Define function to export performance reports
def export_performance_reports(data):
    # Code to export performance reports

# Example usage
export_performance_reports(data)

# Feature: Integration with debugging tools.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular debugging tools to provide code complexity, execution time, and memory usage information.

# Use a debugging tool or library such as PySnooper or Python's built-in debugger to provide information on code complexity, execution time, and memory usage.

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular version control systems such as Git and SVN to allow for easy version control and collaboration.

# Use a version control library such as GitPython or SVN Python to integrate with popular version control systems.

# Feature: Unit testing.
# Scenario: The system should allow for unit testing to ensure code quality and prevent bugs.

# Use a unit testing framework such as pytest or unittest to perform unit tests on the system's code.

# Feature: Error handling.
# Scenario: The system should handle errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages to the user.

# Use the try/except syntax to handle errors and provide helpful messages to the user.
