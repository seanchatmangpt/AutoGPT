# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho.


# Feature: Data validation
# Scenario: Given a set of input data, the system should validate the data according to predefined rules
# This includes identifying and removing redundant code, optimizing algorithms, and suggesting better coding patterns.
def validate_data(input_data, rules):
    # TODO: Implement validation logic
    pass


# Feature: Code collaboration
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to work on the same codebase
# It should also provide suggestions for improving code readability and maintainability.
def collaborate(codebase, users):
    # TODO: Implement collaboration logic
    pass


# Feature: Collaboration and peer review
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to work on the same codebase
# and provide suggestions for improving code readability and maintainability.

# Feature: Code testing
# Scenario: The system should provide a testing framework for the Python code
# allowing developers to run tests
def run_tests(code):

# Feature: Performance metrics and reports
# Scenario: The system should provide metrics and reports for code complexity, coverage, and other relevant performance metrics
# The system should also allow for customization.
