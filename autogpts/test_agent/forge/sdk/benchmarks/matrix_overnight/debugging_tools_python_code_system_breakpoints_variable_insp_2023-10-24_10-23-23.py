# Debugging tools for Python code
# The system should provide debugging tools such as breakpoints, variable inspection

from pdb import set_trace as breakpoint  # import set_trace function from pdb library

# User interface customization
# The Code Generation Engine should allow users to customize the appearance of the generated user interface

# Code formatting
# The system should format the generated code according to predefined coding standards and conventions

import black  # import black code formatter library

# Integration with project management tools
# The system should be able to sync with project management tools such as Jira

import jira  # import jira library for project management integration

# Automated code refactoring
# The system should automatically identify areas of code that can be refactored for improved

import autopep8  # import autopep8 library for automated code refactoring

# Reports and metrics
# These reports should include information on code complexity, test coverage, and code quality
# The system should also allow for custom metrics to be included in the reports

import coverage  # import coverage library for tracking code coverage
import radon  # import radon library for code complexity metrics

# These reports should include information such as runtime, memory usage, and bottleneck areas for optimization
# These metrics could include code complexity, code coverage, and execution time, among others
# These reports can help developers identify areas for optimization and improvement

import timeit  # import timeit library for tracking execution time
import memory_profiler  # import memory_profiler library for tracking memory usage
