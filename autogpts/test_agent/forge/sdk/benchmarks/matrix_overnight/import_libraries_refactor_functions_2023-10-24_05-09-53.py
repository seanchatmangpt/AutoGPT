# Performance analysis can be done using the `performance_insights()` function

# Feature: Integration with other development tools
# Integration reports can be generated using the `integration_reports()` function

# Feature: Task assignment and tracking
# Scenario: The system should allow managers to assign tasks to team members and track their progress
# Task assignment and tracking can be done using the `assign_task()` function

# Feature: User management
# Scenario: The system should allow administrators to create and manage user accounts, assign roles and permissions
# User management can be done using the `user_management()` function
