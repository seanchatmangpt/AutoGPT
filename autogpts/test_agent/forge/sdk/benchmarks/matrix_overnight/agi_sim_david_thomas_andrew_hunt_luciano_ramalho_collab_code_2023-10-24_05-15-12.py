# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho

# Real-time collaboration feature
# Multiple users should be able to work on the same codebase simultaneously and see each other

# Code completion feature
# The Code Editor should suggest code completion options

# Version control integration feature
# The system should allow for integration with popular version control systems like Git and SVN to manage

# Generate reports feature
# These reports should include information on code complexity, execution time, memory usage, and other relevant performance indicators.
# These reports should include information such as code complexity, code quality, and performance benchmarks.
# This will help developers identify potential areas for improvement in terms of performance and efficiency.
