# Feature: Collaboration and team management
# Scenario: The system should generate reports on test results and provide tools for troubleshooting any errors.
# Feature: User authentication
# Scenario: As a user, I want the system to require me to log in with my credentials.
# Feature: Automated testing
# Scenario: The system should automatically run tests on code changes to ensure functionality is not broken.
# Feature: Intelligent code completion
# Scenario: When writing code, the system should provide intelligent code completion based on defined requirements.
# Feature: Code refactoring
# Scenario: The system should automatically update any affected code during refactoring.
# Feature: User account creation
# Scenario: The system should allow users to create an account and login using their credentials.
# Feature: Code reports
# Scenario: The system should generate reports on code complexity, performance bottlenecks, and potential areas for optimization.
