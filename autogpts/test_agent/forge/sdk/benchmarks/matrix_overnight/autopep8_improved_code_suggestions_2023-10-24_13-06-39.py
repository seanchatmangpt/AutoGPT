# Feature: Automatic Code Improvements
# Scenario: The system should provide suggestions for code improvements and automatically implement them upon user approval.

import autopep8

# Convert input to Python code
code = input()

# Apply automatic code improvements
improved_code = autopep8.fix_code(code)

# Print updated code
print(improved_code)

# Feature: Task Assignment and Tracking
# Scenario: Team members should be able to assign tasks to each other and track the progress of

tasks = {}


# Assign task to team member
def assign_task(task, team_member):
    tasks[team_member] = task


# Track task progress
def track_progress(team_member):

# Feature: Report Generation
# Scenario: The system should provide a report on the success or failure of the tests and highlight any issues found in the code.


# Generate report with code complexity, test coverage, and other performance metrics
def generate_report():
    # Code complexity
    complexity = calculate_complexity()
    # Test coverage

    print("Other performance metrics: {}".format(metrics))


# Feature: Integration with Continuous Integration Tools
# Scenario: The system should integrate with continuous integration tools to provide reports on execution time, memory usage, CPU usage, code complexity, performance bottlenecks, and potential areas for improvement.

import continuous_integration_tool

# Set up continuous integration tool
ci_tool = continuous_integration_tool.setup()


# Generate report with execution time, memory usage, CPU usage, code complexity, performance bottlenecks, and potential areas for improvement.
def generate_report():

# Feature: Debugging Support
# Scenario: The system should provide debugging capabilities for Python code, including breakpoints, step-by-step execution.

import pdb

# Set up debugger
debugger = pdb.Pdb()

# Enable breakpoints
debugger.set_trace()

# Step through code execution
while True:
    debugger.step()
