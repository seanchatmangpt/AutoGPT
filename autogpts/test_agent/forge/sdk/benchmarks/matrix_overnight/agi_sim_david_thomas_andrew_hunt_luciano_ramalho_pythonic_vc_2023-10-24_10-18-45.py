# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho

# Transforming input into Python code that aligns with Pythonic practices

# Feature: Integration with version control systems.
# Scenario: The system should integrate with popular version control systems such as Git and Subversion

# Using the built-in module 'os' to check if Git or Subversion is installed
import os

# Using a list comprehension to check if either Git or Subversion is installed
installed = [
    program for program in ["git", "svn"] if os.system(f"which {program}") == 0
]

# Feature: Data validation.
# Scenario: The system should validate user input data against the database schema before storing it in the database.

# Using the built-in module 'json' to load the database schema
import json


# Function to validate user input data against the database schema
def validate_data(data, schema):
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(instance=data, schema=schema)
    except jsonschema.ValidationError:
        print("Invalid data. Please check your input.")


# Feature: Implement data visualization tools.
# Scenario: The system should provide interactive charts and graphs to help users visualize and analyze data.

# Using the library 'plotly' to create interactive charts and graphs
import plotly.graph_objects as go


# Function to create a scatter plot using the given data
def create_scatter_plot(data):
    fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(x=data["x"], y=data["y"]))
    fig.show()


# The system should be able to understand and break down complex sentences and extract key information such as task type, due date, priority

# Using the library 'spacy' for natural language processing
import spacy

# Loading the English language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")


# Function to extract key information from a given sentence
def extract_info(sentence):
    doc = nlp(sentence)
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == "TASK_TYPE":
            task_type = ent.text
        elif ent.label_ == "DUE_DATE":
            due_date = ent.text
        elif ent.label_ == "PRIORITY":
            priority = ent.text
    return task_type, due_date, priority


# Feature: Automated testing.
# Scenario: The system should automatically run and report on unit tests for any changes made to the Python code

# Using the built-in module 'unittest' to run automated tests
import unittest


# Defining a test case class
class Test(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_something(self):
        # Test code goes here
        pass


# Automatically running all tests in the test case
unittest.main()

# Feature: Code optimization.
# Scenario: The system should analyze code performance and provide suggestions for optimization

# Using the built-in module 'timeit' to measure code execution time
import timeit


# Function to test the performance of a given piece of code
def test_performance(code):
    return timeit.timeit(code)


# Feature: Integration with automated testing frameworks.
# Scenario: The system should generate detailed reports on code performance and coverage.

# Using the built-in module 'coverage' for code coverage analysis
import coverage

# Creating a coverage object
cov = coverage.Coverage()

# Starting the coverage measurement
cov.start()

# Code to be tested goes here

# Stopping the coverage measurement
cov.stop()

# Generating a report
cov.report()

# Feature: Automatic code optimization suggestions.
# Scenario: The system should provide suggestions for code optimization based on code complexity, lines of code, and code coverage.


# Function to analyze code complexity
def analyze_complexity(code):
    # Code complexity analysis goes here
    pass


# Function to count the lines of code in a given file
def count_lines(file):
    # Line count code goes here
    pass


# Function to calculate code coverage
def calculate_coverage():
    # Code coverage calculation goes here
    pass
