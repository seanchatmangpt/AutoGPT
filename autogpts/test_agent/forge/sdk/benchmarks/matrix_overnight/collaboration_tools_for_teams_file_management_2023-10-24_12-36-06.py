# File management
# Given a file, the system should be able to create, update, and delete the file


def create_file(file):
    # create file
    return file


def update_file(file):
    # update file
    return file


def delete_file(file):

# Code linting
# The system should check the Python code for potential syntax errors, coding style violations


def lint_code(code):
    # check for syntax errors and coding style violations
    return code


# Performance metrics and reports
# These reports should include data on performance, memory usage, and code complexity


def get_performance_metrics(code):
    # get data on performance, memory usage, and code complexity
    return code


# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho
# This feature should provide insights and reports on code performance and potential bottlenecks


def simulate_AGI(code):
    # simulate code performance and identify bottlenecks
    return code
