# Feature: Code compilation
# Scenario: The system should compile the generated Python code into a runnable format

# Use the subprocess module to run the generated code
import subprocess

# Function to compile and run the generated code
def run_code(code):
    # Use Python's built-in compile function to compile the code
    compiled_code = compile(code, '<string>', 'exec')

    # Use subprocess module to run the compiled code
    process = subprocess.Popen(['python', '-c', compiled_code], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

    # Get the output and error messages from the process
    output, errors = process.communicate()

    # Print the output and error messages
    print(output)
    print(errors)

# Feature: Code execution
# Scenario: The system should execute the compiled code
# Call the run_code function with the generated code as input
run_code(generated_code)

# Feature: Collaboration and project management
# Scenario: The system should allow for collaboration between team members, such as assigning tasks

# Use the built-in dict and list data types to store and manage tasks
tasks = {'Task 1': 'Assigned to User 1', 'Task 2': 'Assigned to User 2'}
task_list = ['Task 1', 'Task 2']

# Function to assign a task to a specific user
def assign_task(task, user):
    tasks[task] = 'Assigned to ' + user

# Function to remove a task from the list
def remove_task(task):
    task_list.remove(task)

# Feature: Team collaboration and communication tools
# Scenario: The system should have features for team members to communicate and collaborate on tasks

# Use the built-in input function to get user input and the print function to display messages
# Function to allow for communication between team members
def communicate():
    print('Enter your message:')
    message = input()
    print('Your message has been sent to the team.')

# Feature: Collaborative coding
# Scenario: The system should allow multiple users to work on the same code simultaneously, with changes being saved and merged

# Use the built-in list and set data types to store and manage the code
code = ['line 1', 'line 2']
changes = set()

# Function to add changes to the code
def add_change(change):
    changes.add(change)

# Function to save and merge the changes
def save_changes():
    code.extend(changes)
    changes.clear()

# Feature: Automated testing framework
# Scenario: The system should have a built-in testing framework to automatically run tests and detect any failures

# Use the built-in unittest module to create and run tests
import unittest

# Define a class for the tests
class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
    # Define a test method
    def test(self):
        # Use the assertEqual method to check for expected results
        self.assertEqual(2 + 2, 4)

# Run the tests using the unittest module's main method
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

# Feature: Task organization and prioritization
# Scenario: Users should be able to organize and prioritize tasks based on due date, importance

# Use the built-in datetime module to work with dates and times
import datetime

# Function to sort tasks by due date
def sort_tasks(tasks):
    # Use the sorted function with the key parameter to sort the tasks based on due date
    return sorted(tasks, key=lambda x: datetime.datetime.strptime(x['due_date'], '%m/%d/%Y'))

# Feature: User authentication
# Scenario: As a user, I want to be able to log in to the system

# Use the built-in getpass module to get user input without displaying it on the screen
import getpass

# Function to authenticate the user
def authenticate():
    # Use the getpass function to get the user's password without displaying it
    password = getpass.getpass(prompt='Enter your password: ')

    # Check if the password is correct
    if password == '1234':
        print('Login successful.')
    else:
        print('Incorrect password.')

# Feature: Integration with testing frameworks
# Scenario: The system should provide reports on code complexity, code coverage, and code quality measures

# Use the built-in cProfile module to generate performance benchmarks
import cProfile

# Use the built-in coverage module to generate code coverage reports
import coverage

# Use the built-in pylint module to generate code quality reports
import pylint

# Function to run and generate reports on code performance, coverage, and quality
def generate_reports():
    # Run the code using cProfile and save the results
    cProfile.run('code_to_test()')

    # Generate a code coverage report and save it
    coverage.run('code_to_test()')
    coverage.report()

    # Generate a pylint report and save it
    pylint.run('code_to_test()')
    pylint.report()
