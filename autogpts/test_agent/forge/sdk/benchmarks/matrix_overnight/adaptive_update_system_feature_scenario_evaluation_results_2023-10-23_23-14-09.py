    Feature: Adaptive System Update
    Scenario: Updating the System Based on Evaluation Results
    Given a system that generates tasks, evaluates user code, and receives evaluation results
    When the evaluation results suggest the following methods to adaptively update the system
    Then the system should implement the following steps

    1. Use a state machine: A state machine is a programming concept that allows you to define a set of states and
       transitions between them. By using a state machine, the system can adaptively update based on the current state.
       (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    2. Interactive coding challenges and exercises: These challenges and exercises can be integrated into the platform
       to provide hands-on practice for users. By providing interactive challenges, the system can adaptively update
       based on user feedback and performance. (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    3. Gamified Learning Experience: Implement a points and rewards system to motivate users to complete tasks and
       challenges. Points can be awarded based on completion time, code quality, and other metrics. By adding gamification
       elements, the system can adaptively update based on user engagement and progress. (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    4. Virtual coding challenges: Add a feature where users can practice coding challenges within the system. This could
       be implemented by integrating with online coding platforms for real-time feedback and guidance. By providing virtual
       coding challenges, the system can adaptively update based on user practice and skill development. (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

def evaluate_system_performance():

    Feature: Adaptive System Update
    Scenario: Evaluate System Performance
    Given that the system has been used for a period of time
    And the internal state is being monitored
    When the system completes a cycle of task generation and execution
    Then evaluate the system performance
    And suggest system updates based on the evaluation results

    1. Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Before collecting any metrics, it is important to identify the key
       performance indicators that align with the system's goals. By identifying KPIs, the system can adaptively update
       based on the specific metrics that matter. (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    2. Collect Metrics: Collecting and reporting metrics for user performance and skill development is an essential part
       of tracking progress and identifying areas for improvement. By collecting metrics, the system can adaptively update
       based on data-driven insights. (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    These methods can be used to adaptively update the system based on evaluation results and improve the overall user experience.

    1. Define the task requirements and gather the Python code to be evaluated. (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    2. Create a class for the task that encapsulates the requirements and evaluation logic. This class should have a method
       to evaluate the code against the requirements. (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    3. Implement the evaluation logic inside the class method. This logic should compare the code against the requirements
       and return a boolean result. (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    Architecture of a Closed-Loop System for Python Coding Tasks:

    A closed-loop system for Python coding tasks requires four main components:

    1. User Interface: The user interface is responsible for displaying the task list, code editor, and evaluation results.
       It should provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users. (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    2. Task Generation: The system should generate tasks based on user needs and preferences. This can be done by defining
       the task requirements and using algorithms to generate relevant tasks. (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    3. Task Execution: The system should provide a user interface for executing the tasks. This interface should include
       features like syntax highlighting, code execution, and evaluation of user code against task requirements.
       (Ref: "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho)

    4. Adaptive System Update: The system should adaptively update based on evaluation results and user feedback. This can
