# Code formatting
# The system should format the generated Python code according to industry standards and best practices.

# Error handling
# The user should have the option to review and approve the changes before they are implemented.
# It should identify and suggest changes to improve the code without altering its functionality.
# It should also update any references to the refactored code within the project.

# Task assignment and tracking
# The system should allow managers to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.

# Real-time code execution
# The system should allow users to execute Python code in real-time, with immediate feedback.

# Code quality metrics
# These reports should include information such as code complexity, test coverage, and performance benchmarks.
# The user should be able to specify which metrics to generate and view them in a user-friendly format.
# These reports should include information such as execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage.

# Code formatting
# The system should format the generated Python code according to industry standards and best practices.
# This can be achieved using the autopep8 library to automatically format the code.

# Error handling
# The refactoring process should be wrapped in a try/except block to catch any potential errors.
# The user should have the option to review and approve the changes before they are implemented.
# The refactor function can take in a parameter for the user to choose whether to implement the changes or not.
# It should identify and suggest changes to improve the code without altering its functionality.
# This can be achieved using a library like pylint to identify code errors and suggest improvements.
# It should also update any references to the refactored code within the project.

# Task assignment and tracking
# The system should allow managers to assign tasks to team members and track their progress.
# This can be achieved by creating a Task class with attributes such as task name, assigned member, and status.
# The system can then store and retrieve tasks using a data structure like a list or dictionary.

# Real-time code execution
# The system should allow users to execute Python code in real-time, with immediate feedback.
# This can be achieved using the exec() function to execute the code and print the result to the console.

# Code quality metrics
# These reports should include information such as code complexity, test coverage, and performance benchmarks.
# The user should be able to specify which metrics to generate and view them in a user-friendly format.
# This can be achieved using libraries like coverage and pytest for code coverage and unit testing.
# Performance benchmarks can be measured using the timeit module.
# The user can then choose which metrics to display and format them using the pprint module.
