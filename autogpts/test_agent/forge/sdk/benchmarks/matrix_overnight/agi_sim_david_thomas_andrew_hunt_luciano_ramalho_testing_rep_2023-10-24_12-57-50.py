# AGI Simulations of David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Luciano Ramalho

# Automated testing and reporting
# The system should run automated tests on each code version and generate a report with feedback on any errors or failures encountered during testing and suggest fixes.

# Code profiling
# The system should have a built-in code profiler that can analyze the performance of the Python code and provide suggestions for code organization and structure to improve maintainability and readability.

# Integration with version control
# The system should be integrated with version control tools to track changes and provide information on code quality, execution time, memory usage, and other relevant performance metrics.

# Performance metrics and reports
# The system should provide metrics and reports on code complexity, code coverage, and execution time to improve the understanding and maintainability of the code.
