# Feature
# Scenario: The system should handle and report any errors that occur during code generation or execution

# Feature
# These reports should include information such as code complexity, code coverage, and performance benchmarks

# Feature
# Scenario: This should include metrics such as execution time, memory usage, and CPU usage, as well as recommendations for optimizations. This will help identify areas for improvement and track progress over time.
