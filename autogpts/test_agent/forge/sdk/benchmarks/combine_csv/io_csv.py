# Explanation:
# First, we import the necessary libraries: csv and pandas. Then, we define a function called combine_csv that takes in three arguments: the names of the two input csv files and the name of the output csv file. Inside the function, we use the read_csv function from pandas to read in the two csv files as dataframes. Then, we use the merge function from pandas to merge the two dataframes on the 'ID' column. Next, we use the sort_values function to sort the rows by the 'ID' column in ascending order. Finally, we use the reindex function to sort the columns alphabetically. Lastly, we use the to_csv function to write the output dataframe to a new csv file. We call the function with the given file names to execute the task.
