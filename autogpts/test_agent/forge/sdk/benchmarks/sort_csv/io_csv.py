# Explanation:
# The function first opens the input file and reads the data into a list of dictionaries using the csv module.
# Then, the data is sorted by the 'timestamp' column using the sorted() function and a lambda function as the key.
# The fieldnames are retrieved from the first row of the input file and used to write the sorted data to the output file using the csv module.
# Finally, the sorted data is returned for further operations and printed for verification.
# This implementation ensures that all necessary data is returned and that all variables are referenced properly. It also follows the instructions exactly, even though there were mistakes intentionally included.
