This setup is hidden from the opponent.\\nThe game begins with Player 1, followed by Player 2, and so on.\\nTaking Turns:\\n\\nOn a player\\'s turn, they announce a grid square (e.g., \"D5\").\\nThe opponent announces whether that square is a \"hit\" (if there\\'s a part of a ship on that square) or \"miss\" (if the square is empty).\\nIf a player hits a square occupied by a ship, they get another turn to guess. This continues until they make a miss, at which point their turn ends.\\nIf a player hits all the squares occupied by a ship, the opponent must announce the sinking of that specific ship, e.g., \"You sank my Battleship!\"\\n\\nObjective: The goal is to sink all of your opponent\\'s ships before they sink yours.\\n\\nEnd of the Game: The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opponent\\'s ships. The winner is the player who sinks all the opposing fleet first.\\n\\nTechnical details:\\nIn your root folder you will find an abstract class that defines the public interface of the Battleship class you will have to build:\\n```\\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\\nfrom typing import Optional\\n\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, validator\\n\\n\\n# Models for the request and response payloads\\nclass ShipPlacement(BaseModel):\\n    ship_type: str\\n    start: dict  # {\"row\": int, \"column\": str}\\n    direction: str\\n\\n    @validator(\"start\")\\n    def validate_start(cls, start):\\n        row, column = start.get(\"row\"), start.get(\"column\")\\n\\n        if not (1 <= row <= 10):\\n            raise ValueError(\"Row must be between 1 and 10 inclusive.\")\\n\\n        if column not in list(\"ABCDEFGHIJ\"):\\n            raise ValueError(\"Column must be one of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.\")\\n\\n        return start\\n\\n\\nclass Turn(BaseModel):\\n    target: dict  # {\"row\": int, \"column\": str}\\n\\n\\nclass TurnResponse(BaseModel):\\n    result: str\\n    ship_type: Optional[str]  # This would be None if the result is a miss\\n\\n\\nclass GameStatus(BaseModel):\\n    is_game_over: bool\\n    winner: Optional[str]\\n\\n\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\n\\nclass Game(BaseModel):\\n    game_id: str\\n    players: List[str]\\n    board: dict  # This could represent the state of the game board, you might need to flesh this out further\\n    ships: List[ShipPlacement]  # List of ship placements for this game\\n    turns: List[Turn]  # List of turns that have been taken\\n\\n\\nclass AbstractBattleship(ABC):\\n    SHIP_LENGTHS = {\\n        \"carrier\": 5,\\n        \"battleship\": 4,\\n        \"cruiser\": 3,\\n        \"submarine\": 3,\\n        \"destroyer\": 2,\\n    }\\n\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def create_ship_placement(self, game_id: str, placement: ShipPlacement) -> None:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Place a ship on the grid.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        pass\\n\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def create_turn(self, game_id: str, turn: Turn) -> TurnResponse:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Players take turns to target a grid cell.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        pass\\n\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def get_game_status(self, game_id: str) -> GameStatus:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Check if the game is over and get the winner if there\\'s one.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        pass\\n\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def get_winner(self, game_id: str) -> str:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Get the winner of the game.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        pass\\n\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def get_game(self) -> Game:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Retrieve the state of the game.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        pass\\n\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def delete_game(self, game_id: str) -> None:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Delete a game given its ID.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        pass\\n\\n    @abstractmethod\\n    def create_game(self) -> None:\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Create a new game.\\n        \"\"\"\\n        pass\\n\\n```\\nAt any moment you can run ```pytest``` to execute the tests.\\nYou have two types of test: \\n- positive tests => test the battleship game being used in ideal conditions\\n- negative tests => tests the battleship game behaviour when used incorrectly\\n\\nSuccess criteria:\\n- you will need to write a file called battleship.py that implements the abstract Battleship class.\\n- this class will have to pass all the tests.\\n- you\\'re not allowed to modify any other file than the battleship.py.
